<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Samuel Johnson</span>, born at Lichfield
in the year 1709, on the 7th of September Old Style, 18th New
Style, was sixty-eight years old when he agreed with the
booksellers to write his &ldquo;Lives of the English
Poets.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am engaged,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;to write little Lives, and little Prefaces, to a little
edition of the English Poets.&rdquo;&nbsp; His conscience was
also a little hurt by the fact that the bargain was made on
Easter Eve.&nbsp; In 1777 his memorandum, set down among prayers
and meditations, was &ldquo;29 March, Easter Eve, I treated with
booksellers on a bargain, but the time was not long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The history of the book as told to Boswell by Edward Dilly,
one of the contracting booksellers, was this.&nbsp; An edition of
Poets printed by the Martins in Edinburgh, and sold by Bell in
London, was regarded by the London publishers as an interference
with the honorary copyright which booksellers then respected
among themselves.&nbsp; They said also that it was inaccurately
printed and its type was small.&nbsp; A few booksellers agreed,
therefore, among themselves to call a meeting of proprietors of
honorary or actual copyright in the various Poets.&nbsp; In Poets
who had died before 1660 they had no trade interest at all.&nbsp;
About forty of the most respectable booksellers in London
accepted the invitation to this meeting.&nbsp; They determined to
proceed immediately with an elegant and uniform edition of Poets
in whose works they were interested, and they deputed three of
their number, William Strahan, Thomas Davies, and Cadell, to wait
on Johnson, asking him to write the series of prefatory Lives,
and name his own terms.&nbsp; Johnson agreed at once, and
suggested as his price two hundred guineas, when, as Malone says,
the booksellers would readily have given him a thousand.&nbsp; He
then contemplated only &ldquo;little Lives.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
energetic pleasure in the work expanded his Preface beyond the
limits of the first design; but when it was observed to Johnson
that he was underpaid by the booksellers, his reply was,
&ldquo;No, sir; it was not that they gave me too little, but that
I gave them too much.&rdquo;&nbsp; He gave them, in fact, his
masterpiece.&nbsp; His keen interest in Literature as the soul of
life, his sympathetic insight into human nature, enabled him to
put all that was best in himself into these studies of the lives
of men for whom he cared, and of the books that he was glad to
speak his mind about in his own shrewd independent way.&nbsp;
Boswell was somewhat disappointed at finding that the selection
of the Poets in this series would not be Johnson&rsquo;s, but
that he was to furnish a Preface and Life to any Poet the
booksellers pleased.&nbsp; &ldquo;I asked him,&rdquo; writes
Boswell, &ldquo;if he would do this to any dunce&rsquo;s works,
if they should ask him.&rdquo;&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Johnson</span>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, sir; and
<i>say</i> he was a dunce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The meeting of booksellers, happy in the support of
Johnson&rsquo;s intellectual power, appointed also a committee to
engage the best engravers, and another committee to give
directions about paper and printing.&nbsp; They made out at once
a list of the Poets they meant to give, &ldquo;many of
which,&rdquo; said Dilly, &ldquo;are within the time of the Act
of Queen Anne, which Martin and Bell cannot give, as they have no
property in them.&nbsp; The proprietors are almost all the
booksellers in London, of consequence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1780 the booksellers published, in separate form, four
volumes of Johnson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prefaces, Biographical and
Critical, to the most Eminent of the English Poets.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The completion followed in 1781.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sometime in
March,&rdquo; Johnson writes in that year, &ldquo;I finished the
Lives of the Poets.&rdquo;&nbsp; The series of books to which
they actually served as prefaces extended to sixty volumes.&nbsp;
When his work was done, Johnson then being in his seventy-second
year, the booksellers added &pound;100 to the price first
asked.&nbsp; Johnson&rsquo;s own life was then near its
close.&nbsp; He died on the 13th of December, 1784, aged
seventy-five.</p>
<p>Of the Lives in this collection, Johnson himself liked best
his Life of Cowley, for the thoroughness with which he had
examined in it the style of what he called the metaphysical
Poets.&nbsp; In his Life of Milton, the sense of Milton&rsquo;s
genius is not less evident than the difference in point of view
which made it difficult for Johnson to know Milton
thoroughly.&nbsp; They know each other now.&nbsp; For Johnson
sought as steadily as Milton to do all as &ldquo;in his great
Taskmaster&rsquo;s eye.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>WALLER.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Edmund Waller</span> was born on the third
of March, 1605, at Coleshill, in Hertfordshire.&nbsp; His father
was Robert Waller, Esquire, of Agmondesham, in Buckinghamshire,
whose family was originally a branch of the Kentish Wallers; and
his mother was the daughter of John Hampden, of Hampden, in the
same county, and sister to Hampden, the zealot of rebellion.</p>
<p>His father died while he was yet an infant, but left him a
yearly income of three thousand five hundred pounds; which,
rating together the value of money and the customs of life, we
may reckon more than equivalent to ten thousand at the present
time.</p>
<p>He was educated, by the care of his mother, at Eton; and
removed afterwards to King&rsquo;s College, in Cambridge.&nbsp;
He was sent to Parliament in his eighteenth, if not in his
sixteenth year, and frequented the court of James the First,
where he heard a very remarkable conversation, which the writer
of the Life prefixed to his Works, who seems to have been well
informed of facts, though he may sometimes err in chronology, has
delivered as indubitably certain:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He found Dr. Andrews, Bishop of Winchester, and Dr.
Neale, Bishop of Durham, standing behind his Majesty&rsquo;s
chair; and there happened something extraordinary,&rdquo;
continues this writer, &ldquo;in the conversation those prelates
had with the king, on which Mr. Waller did often reflect.&nbsp;
His Majesty asked the bishops, &lsquo;My Lords, cannot I take my
subject&rsquo;s money, when I want it, without all this formality
of Parliament?&rsquo;&nbsp; The Bishop of Durham readily
answered, &lsquo;God forbid, Sir, but you should: you are the
breath of our nostrils.&rsquo;&nbsp; Whereupon the king turned
and said to the Bishop of Winchester, &lsquo;Well, my Lord, what
say you?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; replied the bishop,
&lsquo;I have no skill to judge of Parliamentary cases.&nbsp; The
king answered, &lsquo;No put-offs, my Lord; answer me
presently.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Then, Sir,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;I think it is lawful for you to take my brother
Neale&rsquo;s money; for he offers it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Waller
said the company was pleased with this answer, and the wit of it
seemed to affect the king; for a certain lord coming in soon
after, his Majesty cried out, &lsquo;Oh, my lord, they say you
lig with my Lady.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No, Sir,&rsquo; says his
lordship in confusion; &lsquo;but I like her company, because she
has so much wit.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, then,&rsquo; says the
king, &lsquo;do you not lig with my Lord of Winchester
there?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waller&rsquo;s political and poetical life began nearly
together.&nbsp; In his eighteenth year he wrote the poem that
appears first in his works, on &ldquo;The Prince&rsquo;s Escape
at St. Andero:&rdquo; a piece which justifies the observation
made by one of his editors, that he attained, by a felicity like
instinct, a style which perhaps will never be obsolete; and that
&ldquo;were we to judge only by the wording, we could not know
what was wrote at twenty, and what at&rsquo;
fourscore.&rdquo;&nbsp; His versification was, in his first
essay, such as it appears in his last performance.&nbsp; By the
perusal of Fairfax&rsquo;s translation of Tasso, to which, as
Dryden relates, he confessed himself indebted for the smoothness
of his numbers, and by his own nicety of observation, he had
already formed such a system of metrical harmony as he never
afterwards much needed, or much endeavoured, to improve.&nbsp;
Denham corrected his numbers by experience, and gained ground
gradually upon the ruggedness of his age; but what was acquired
by Denham was inherited by Waller.</p>
<p>The next poem, of which the subject seems to fix the time, is
supposed by Mr. Fenton to be the &ldquo;Address to the
Queen,&rdquo; which he considers as congratulating her arrival,
in Waller&rsquo;s twentieth year.&nbsp; He is apparently
mistaken; for the mention of the nation&rsquo;s obligations to
her frequent pregnancy proves that it was written when she had
brought many children.&nbsp; We have therefore no date of any
other poetical production before that which the murder of the
Duke of Buckingham occasioned; the steadiness with which the king
received the news in the chapel deserved indeed to be rescued
from oblivion.</p>
<p>Neither of these pieces that seem to carry their own dates
could have been the sudden effusion of fancy.&nbsp; In the verses
on the prince&rsquo;s escape, the prediction of his marriage with
the Princess of France must have been written after the event; in
the other, the promises of the king&rsquo;s kindness to the
descendants of Buckingham, which could not be properly praised
till it had appeared by its effects, show that time was taken for
revision and improvement.&nbsp; It is not known that they were
published till they appeared long afterwards with other
poems.</p>
<p>Waller was not one of those idolaters of praise who cultivate
their minds at the expense of their fortunes.&nbsp; Rich as he
was by inheritance, he took care early to grow richer, by
marrying Mrs. Banks, a great heiress in the city, whom the
interest of the court was employed to obtain for Mr.
Crofts.&nbsp; Having brought him a son, who died young, and a
daughter, who was afterwards married to Mr. Dormer, of
Oxfordshire, she died in childbed, and left him a widower of
about five-and-twenty, gay and wealthy, to please himself with
another marriage.</p>
<p>Being too young to resist beauty, and probably too vain to
think himself resistible, he fixed his heart, perhaps half-fondly
and half-ambitiously, upon the Lady Dorothea Sidney, eldest
daughter of the Earl of Leicester, whom he courted by all the
poetry in which Sacharissa is celebrated; the name is derived
from the Latin appellation of &ldquo;sugar,&rdquo; and implies,
if it means anything, a spiritless mildness, and dull
good-nature, such as excites rather tenderness and esteem, and
such as, though always treated with kindness, is never honoured
or admired.</p>
<p>Yet he describes Sacharissa as a sublime predominating beauty,
of lofty charms, and imperious influence, on whom he looks with
amazement rather than fondness, whose chains he wishes, though in
vain, to break, and whose presence is &ldquo;wine&rdquo; that
&ldquo;inflames to madness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His acquaintance with this high-born dame gave wit no
opportunity of boasting its influence; she was not to be subdued
by the powers of verse, but rejected his addresses, it is said,
with disdain, and drove him away to solace his disappointment
with Amoret or Phillis.&nbsp; She married in 1639 the Earl of
Sunderland, who died at Newbury in the king&rsquo;s cause; and,
in her old age, meeting somewhere with Waller, asked him, when he
would again write such verses upon her; &ldquo;When you are as
young, Madam,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and as handsome as you were
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this part of his life it was that he was known to
Clarendon, among the rest of the men who were eminent in that age
for genius and literature; but known so little to his advantage,
that they who read his character will not much condemn
Sacharissa, that she did not descend from her rank to his
embraces, nor think every excellence comprised in wit.</p>
<p>The lady was, indeed, inexorable; but his uncommon comprised
in wit, qualifications, though they had no power upon her,
recommended him to the scholars and statesmen; and undoubtedly
many beauties of that time, however they might receive his love,
were proud of his praises.&nbsp; Who they were, whom he dignifies
with poetical names, cannot now be known.&nbsp; Amoret, according
to Mr. Fenton, was the Lady Sophia Murray.&nbsp; Perhaps by
traditions preserved in families more may be discovered.</p>
<p>From the verses written at Penshurst, it has been collected
that he diverted his disappointment by a voyage; and his
biographers, from his poem on the Whales, think it not improbable
that he visited the Bermudas; but it seems much more likely that
he should amuse himself with forming an imaginary scene, than
that so important an incident, as a visit to America, should have
been left floating in conjectural probability.</p>
<p>From his twenty-eighth to his thirty-fifth year, he wrote his
pieces on the Reduction of Sallee; on the Reparation of St.
Paul&rsquo;s; to the King on his Navy; the Panegyric on the Queen
Mother; the two poems to the Earl of Northumberland; and perhaps
others, of which the time cannot be discovered.</p>
<p>When he had lost all hopes of Sacharissa, he looked round him
for an easier conquest, and gained a lady of the family of
Bresse, or Breaux.&nbsp; The time of his marriage is not exactly
known.&nbsp; It has not been discovered that his wife was won by
his poetry; nor is anything told of her, but that she brought him
many children.&nbsp; He doubtless praised some whom he would have
been afraid to marry, and perhaps married one whom he would have
been ashamed to praise.&nbsp; Many qualities contribute to
domestic happiness, upon which poetry has no colours to bestow;
and many airs and sallies may delight imagination, which he who
flatters them never can approve.&nbsp; There are charms made only
for distant admiration.&nbsp; No spectacle is nobler than a
blaze.</p>
<p>Of this wife, his biographers have recorded that she gave him
five sons and eight daughters.</p>
<p>During the long interval of Parliament, he is represented as
living among those with whom it was most honourable to converse,
and enjoying an exuberant fortune with that independence and
liberty of speech and conduct which wealth ought always to
produce.&nbsp; He was, however, considered as the kinsman of
Hampden, and was therefore supposed by the courtiers not to
favour them.</p>
<p>When the Parliament was called in 1640, it appeared that
Waller&rsquo;s political character had not been mistaken.&nbsp;
The king&rsquo;s demand of a supply produced one of those noisy
speeches which disaffection and discontent regularly dictate; a
speech filled with hyperbolical complaints of imaginary
grievances: &ldquo;They,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;who think
themselves already undone, can never apprehend themselves in
danger; and they who have nothing left can never give
freely.&rdquo;&nbsp; Political truth is equally in danger from
the praises of courtiers, and the exclamations of patriots.</p>
<p>He then proceeds to rail at the clergy, being sure at that
time of a favourable audience.&nbsp; His topic is such as will
always serve its purpose; an accusation of acting and preaching
only for preferment: and he exhorts the Commons
&ldquo;carefully&rdquo; to &ldquo;provide&rdquo; for their
&ldquo;protection against Pulpit Law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It always gratifies curiosity to trace a sentiment.&nbsp;
Waller has in his speech quoted Hooker in one passage; and in
another has copied him, without quoting.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Religion,&rdquo; says Waller, &ldquo;ought to be the first
thing in our purpose and desires; but that which is first in
dignity is not always to precede in order of time; for well-being
supposes a being; and the first impediment which men naturally
endeavour to remove, is the want of those things without which
they cannot subsist.&nbsp; God first assigned unto Adam
maintenance of life, and gave him a title to the rest of the
creatures before he appointed a law to observe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God first assigned Adam,&rdquo; says Hooker,
&ldquo;maintenance of life, and then appointed him a law to
observe.&nbsp; True it is, that the kingdom of God must be the
first thing in our purpose and desires; but inasmuch as a
righteous life presupposeth life, inasmuch as to live virtuously
it is impossible, except we live; therefore the first impediment
which naturally we endeavour to remove is penury, and want of
things without which we cannot live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speech is vehement; but the great position, that
grievances ought to be redressed before supplies are granted, is
agreeable enough to law and reason: nor was Waller, if his
biographer may be credited, such an enemy to the king, as not to
wish his distresses lightened; for he relates, &ldquo;that the
king sent particularly to Waller, to second his demand of some
subsidies to pay off the army, and Sir Henry Vane objecting
against first voting a supply, because the king would not accept
unless it came up to his proportion, Mr. Waller spoke earnestly
to Sir Thomas Jermyn, comptroller of the household, to save his
master from the effects of so bold a falsity; &lsquo;for,&rsquo;
he said, &lsquo;I am but a country gentleman, and cannot pretend
to know the king&rsquo;s mind:&rsquo; but Sir Thomas durst not
contradict the secretary; and his son, the Earl of St. Albans,
afterwards told Mr. Waller, that his father&rsquo;s cowardice
ruined the king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Long Parliament, which, unhappily for the nation, met
Nov. 3, 1640, Waller represented Agmondesham the third time; and
was considered by the discontented party as a man sufficiently
trusty and acrimonious to be employed in managing the prosecution
of Judge Crawley, for his opinion in favour of ship-money; and
his speech shows that he did not disappoint their
expectations.&nbsp; He was probably the more ardent, as his uncle
Hampden had been particularly engaged in the dispute, and, by a
sentence which seems generally to be thought unconstitutional,
particularly injured.</p>
<p>He was not, however, a bigot to his party, nor adopted all
their opinions.&nbsp; When the great question, whether Episcopacy
ought to be abolished, was debated, he spoke against the
innovation so coolly, so reasonably, and so firmly, that it is
not without great injury to his name that his speech, which was
as follows, has been hitherto omitted in his works:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt but the sense of what this nation had
suffered from the present bishops hath produced these complaints;
and the apprehensions men have of suffering the like, in time to
come, make so many desire the taking away of Episcopacy: but I
conceive it is possible that we may not, now, take a right
measure of the minds of the people by their petitions; for, when
they subscribed them, the bishops were armed with a dangerous
commission of making new canons, imposing new oaths, and the
like; but now we have disarmed them of that power.&nbsp; These
petitioners lately did look upon Episcopacy as a beast armed with
horns and claws; but now that we have cut and pared them (and
may, if we see cause, yet reduce it into narrower bounds), it
may, perhaps, be more agreeable.&nbsp; Howsoever, if they be
still in passion, it becomes us soberly to consider the right use
and antiquity thereof; and not to comply further with a general
desire, than may stand with a general good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have already showed that Episcopacy and the evils
thereof are mingled like water and oil; we have also, in part,
severed them; but I believe you will find, that our laws and the
present government of the Church are mingled like wine and water;
so inseparable, that the abrogation of, at least, a hundred of
our laws is desired in these petitions.&nbsp; I have often heard
a noble answer of the Lords, commended in this House, to a
proposition of like nature, but of less consequence; they gave no
other reason of their refusal but this, &lsquo;<i>Nolumus mutare
Leges Angli&aelig;</i>:&rsquo; it was the bishops who so answered
them; and it would become the dignity and wisdom of this House to
answer the people, now, with a &lsquo;<i>Nolumus
mutare</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see some are moved with a number of hands against the
bishops; which, I confess, rather inclines me to their defence;
for I look upon Episcopacy as a counterscarp, or outwork; which,
if it be taken by this assault of the people, and, withal, this
mystery once revealed, &lsquo;that we must deny them nothing when
they ask it thus in troops,&rsquo; we may, in the next place,
have as hard a task to defend our property, as we have lately had
to recover it from the Prerogative.&nbsp; If, by multiplying
hands and petitions, they prevail for an equality in things
ecclesiastical, the next demand perhaps may be <i>Lex
Agraria</i>, the like equality in things temporal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Roman story tells us, that when the people began to
flock about the Senate, and were more curious to direct and know
what was done, than to obey, that Commonwealth soon came to ruin;
their <i>Legem regare</i> grew quickly to be a <i>Legem
ferre</i>: and after, when their legions had found that they
could make a Dictator, they never suffered the Senate to have a
voice any more in such election.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If these great innovations proceed, I shall expect a
flat and level in learning too, as well as in Church preferments:
<i>Hones alit Artes</i>.&nbsp; And though it be true, that grave
and pious men do study for learning-sake, and embrace virtue for
itself; yet it is true, that youth, which is the season when
learning is gotten, is not without ambition; nor will ever take
pains to excel in anything, when there is not some hope of
excelling others in reward and dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two reasons chiefly alleged against our
Church government.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, Scripture, which, as some men think, points out
another form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second, the abuses of the present superiors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Scripture, I will not dispute it in this place; but
I am confident that, whenever an equal division of lands and
goods shall be desired, there will be as many places in Scripture
found out, which seem to favour that, as there are now alleged
against the prelacy or preferment of the Church.&nbsp; And, as
for abuses, when you are now in the remonstrance told what this
and that poor man hath suffered by the bishops, you may be
presented with a thousand instances of poor men that have
received hard measure from their landlords; and of worldly goods
abused, to the injury of others, and disadvantage of the
owners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And therefore, Mr. Speaker, my humble motion is that we
may settle men&rsquo;s minds herein; and by a question, declare
our resolution, &lsquo;to reform,&rsquo; that is, &lsquo;not to
abolish, Episcopacy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It cannot but be wished that he, who could speak in this
manner, had been able to act with spirit and uniformity.</p>
<p>When the Commons begun to set the royal authority at open
defiance, Waller is said to have withdrawn from the House, and to
have returned with the king&rsquo;s permission; and, when the
king set up his standard, he sent him a thousand
broad-pieces.&nbsp; He continued, however, to sit in the
rebellious conventicle; but &ldquo;spoke,&rdquo; says Clarendon,
&ldquo;with great sharpness and freedom, which, now there was no
danger of being out-voted, was not restrained; and therefore used
as an argument against those who were gone upon pretence that
they were not suffered to deliver their opinion freely in the
House, which could not be believed, when all men knew what
liberty Mr. Waller took, and spoke every day with impunity
against the sense and proceedings of the House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waller, as he continued to sit, was one of the commissioners
nominated by the Parliament to treat with the king at Oxford; and
when they were presented, the king said to him, &ldquo;Though you
are the last, you are not the lowest nor the least in my
favour.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whitelock, who, being another of the
commissioners, was witness of this kindness, imputes it to the
king&rsquo;s knowledge of the plot, in which Waller appeared
afterwards to have been engaged against the Parliament.&nbsp;
Fenton, with equal probability, believes that his attempt to
promote the royal cause arose from his sensibility of the
king&rsquo;s tenderness.&nbsp; Whitelock says nothing of his
behaviour at Oxford: he was sent with several others to add pomp
to the commission, but was not one of those to whom the trust of
treating was imparted.</p>
<p>The engagement, known by the name of Waller&rsquo;s plot, was
soon afterwards discovered.&nbsp; Waller had a brother-in-law,
Tomkyns, who was clerk of the queen&rsquo;s council, and at the
same time had a very numerous acquaintance, and great influence,
in the city.&nbsp; Waller and he, conversing with great
confidence, told both their own secrets and those of their
friends; and, surveying the wide extent of their conversation,
imagined that they found in the majority of all ranks great
disapprobation of the violence of the Commons, and unwillingness
to continue the war.&nbsp; They knew that many favoured the king,
whose fear concealed their loyalty; and many desired peace,
though they durst not oppose the clamour for war; and they
imagined that, if those who had these good intentions should be
informed of their own strength, and enabled by intelligence to
act together, they might overpower the fury of sedition, by
refusing to comply with the ordinance for the twentieth part, and
the other taxes levied for the support of the rebel army, and by
uniting great numbers in a petition for peace.&nbsp; They
proceeded with great caution.&nbsp; Three only met in one place,
and no man was allowed to impart the plot to more than two
others; so that, if any should be suspected or seized, more than
three could not be endangered.</p>
<p>Lord Conway joined in the design, and, Clarendon imagines,
incidentally mingled, as he was a soldier, some martial hopes or
projects, which however were only mentioned, the main design
being to bring the loyal inhabitants to the knowledge of each
other; for which purpose there was to be appointed one in every
district, to distinguish the friends of the king, the adherents
to the Parliament, and the neutrals.&nbsp; How far they proceeded
does not appear; the result of their inquiry, as Pym declared,
was, that within the walls, for one that was for the Royalists,
there were three against them; but that without the walls, for
one that was against them, there were five for them.&nbsp;
Whether this was said from knowledge or guess, was perhaps never
inquired.</p>
<p>It is the opinion of Clarendon, that in Waller&rsquo;s plan no
violence or sanguinary resistance was comprised; that he intended
only to abate the confidence of the rebels by public
declarations, and to weaken their powers by an opposition to new
supplies.&nbsp; This, in calmer times, and more than this, is
done without fear; but such was the acrimony of the Commons, that
no method of obstructing them was safe.</p>
<p>About this time another design was formed by Sir Nicholas
Crispe, a man of loyalty, that deserves perpetual remembrance;
when he was a merchant in the city, he gave and procured the
king, in his exigencies, a hundred thousand pounds; and, when he
was driven from the Exchange, raised a regiment, and commanded
it.</p>
<p>Sir Nicholas flattered himself with an opinion, that some
provocation would so much exasperate, or some opportunity so much
encourage, the king&rsquo;s friends in the city, that they would
break out in open resistance, and would then want only a lawful
standard, and an authorised commander; and extorted from the
king, whose judgment too frequently yielded to importunity, a
commission of array, directed to such as he thought proper to
nominate, which was sent to London by the Lady Aubigny.&nbsp; She
knew not what she carried, but was to deliver it on the
communication of a certain token which Sir Nicholas imparted.</p>
<p>This commission could be only intended to lie ready till the
time should require it.&nbsp; To have attempted to raise any
forces would have been certain destruction; it could be of use
only when the forces should appear.&nbsp; This was, however, an
act preparatory to martial hostility.</p>
<p>Crispe would undoubtedly have put an end to the session of
Parliament, had his strength been equal to his zeal; and out of
the design of Crispe, which involved very little danger, and that
of Waller, which was an act purely civil, they compounded a
horrid and dreadful plot.</p>
<p>The discovery of Waller&rsquo;s design is variously
related.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Clarendon&rsquo;s History&rdquo; it is told, that a
servant of Tomkyns, lurking behind the hangings when his master
was in conference with Waller, heard enough to qualify him for an
informer, and carried his intelligence to Pym.</p>
<p>A manuscript, quoted in the &ldquo;Life of Waller,&rdquo;
relates, that &ldquo;he was betrayed by his sister Price, and her
Presbyterian chaplain Mr. Goode, who stole some of his papers;
and if he had not strangely dreamed the night before, that his
sister had betrayed him, and thereupon burnt the rest of his
papers by the fire that was in his chimney, he had certainly lost
his life by it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The question cannot be
decided.&nbsp; It is not unreasonable to believe that the men in
power, receiving intelligence from the sister, would employ the
servant of Tomkyns to listen at the conference, that they might
avoid an act so offensive as that of destroying the brother by
the sister&rsquo;s testimony.</p>
<p>The plot was published in the most terrific manner.</p>
<p>On the 31st of May (1643), at a solemn fast, when they were
listening to the sermon, a messenger entered the church, and
communicated his errand to Pym, who whispered it to others that
were placed near him, and then went with them out of the church,
leaving the rest in solicitude and amazement.&nbsp; They
immediately sent guards to proper places, and that night
apprehended Tomkyns and Waller; having yet traced nothing but
that letters had been intercepted, from which it appears that the
Parliament and the city were soon to be delivered into the hands
of the cavaliers.</p>
<p>They perhaps yet knew little themselves, beyond some general
and indistinct notices.&nbsp; &ldquo;But Waller,&rdquo; says
Clarendon, &ldquo;was so confounded with fear, that he confessed
whatever he had heard, said, thought, or seen; all that he knew
of himself, and all that he suspected of others, without
concealing any person of what degree or quality soever, or any
discourse which he had ever upon any occasion entertained with
them; what such and such ladies of great honour, to whom, upon
the credit of his wit and great reputation, he had been admitted,
had spoken to him in their chambers upon the proceedings in the
Houses, and how they had encouraged him to oppose them; what
correspondence and intercourse they had with some Ministers of
State at Oxford, and how they had conveyed all intelligence
thither.&rdquo;&nbsp; He accused the Earl of Portland and Lord
Conway as co-operating in the transaction; and testified that the
Earl of Northumberland had declared himself disposed in favour of
any attempt that might check the violence of the Parliament, and
reconcile them to the king.</p>
<p>He undoubtedly confessed much which they could never have
discovered, and perhaps somewhat which they would wish to have
been suppressed; for it is inconvenient in the conflict of
factions, to have that disaffection known which cannot safely be
punished.</p>
<p>Tomkyns was seized on the same night with Waller, and appears
likewise to have partaken of his cowardice; for he gave notice of
Crispe&rsquo;s commission of array, of which Clarendon never knew
how it was discovered.&nbsp; Tomkyns had been sent with the token
appointed, to demand it from Lady Aubigny, and had buried it in
his garden, where, by his direction, it was dug up; and thus the
rebels obtained, what Clarendon confesses them to have had, the
original copy.</p>
<p>It can raise no wonder that they formed one plot out of these
two designs, however remote from each other, when they saw the
same agent employed in both, and found the commission of array in
the hands of him who was employed in collecting the opinions and
affections of the people.</p>
<p>Of the plot, thus combined, they took care to make the
most.&nbsp; They sent Pym among the citizens, to tell them of
their imminent danger and happy escape; and inform them, that the
design was, &ldquo;to seize the Lord Mayor and all the Committee
of Militia, and would not spare one of them.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
drew up a vow and covenant, to be taken by every member of either
House, by which he declared his detestation of all conspiracies
against the Parliament, and his resolution to detect and oppose
them.&nbsp; They then appointed a day of thanksgiving for this
wonderful delivery; which shut out, says Clarendon, all doubts
whether there had been such a deliverance, and whether the plot
was real or fictitious.</p>
<p>On June 11, the Earl of Portland and Lord Conway were
committed, one to the custody of the mayor, and the other of the
sheriff; but their lands and goods were not seized.</p>
<p>Waller was still to immerse himself deeper in ignominy.&nbsp;
The Earl of Portland and Lord Conway denied the charge; and there
was no evidence against them but the confession of Waller, of
which undoubtedly many would be inclined to question the
veracity.&nbsp; With these doubts he was so much terrified, that
he endeavoured to persuade Portland to a declaration like his
own, by a letter extant in Fenton&rsquo;s edition.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But for me,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you had never known
anything of this business, which was prepared for another; and
therefore I cannot imagine why you should hide it so far as to
contract your own ruin by concealing it, and persisting
unreasonably to hide that truth, which, without you, already is,
and will every day be made more manifest.&nbsp; Can you imagine
yourself bound in honour to keep that secret, which is already
revealed by another? or possible it should still be a secret,
which is known to one of the other sex?&mdash;If you persist to
be cruel to yourself for their sakes who deserve it not, it will
nevertheless be made appear, ere long, I fear, to your
ruin.&nbsp; Surely, if I had the happiness to wait on you, I
could move you to compassionate both yourself and me, who,
desperate as my case is, am desirous to die with the honour of
being known to have declared the truth.&nbsp; You have no reason
to contend to hide what is already revealed&mdash;inconsiderately
to throw away yourself, for the interest of others, to whom you
are less obliged than you are aware of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This persuasion seems to have had little effect.&nbsp;
Portland sent (June 29) a letter to the Lords, to tell them that
he &ldquo;is in custody, as he conceives, without any charge; and
that, by what Mr. Waller hath threatened him with since he was
imprisoned, he doth apprehend a very cruel, long, and ruinous
restraint:&mdash;He therefore prays, that he may not find the
effects of Mr. Waller&rsquo;s threats, a long and close
imprisonment; but may be speedily brought to a legal trial, and
then he is confident the vanity and falsehood of those
informations which have been given against him will
appear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In consequence of this letter, the Lords ordered Portland and
Waller to be confronted; when the one repeated his charge, and
the other his denial.&nbsp; The examination of the plot being
continued (July 1), Thinn, usher of the House of Lords, deposed,
that Mr. Waller having had a conference with the Lord Portland in
an upper room, Lord Portland said, when he came down, &ldquo;Do
me the favour to tell my Lord Northumberland, that Mr. Waller has
extremely pressed me to save my own life and his, by throwing the
blame upon the Lord Conway and the Earl of
Northumberland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waller, in his letter to Portland, tells him of the reasons
which he could urge with resistless efficacy in a personal
conference; but he overrated his own oratory; his vehemence,
whether of persuasion or entreaty, was returned with
contempt.</p>
<p>One of his arguments with Portland is, that the plot is
already known to a woman.&nbsp; This woman was doubtless Lady
Aubigny, who, upon this occasion, was committed to custody; but
who, in reality, when she delivered the commission, knew not what
it was.</p>
<p>The Parliament then proceeded against the conspirators, and
committed their trial to a council of war.&nbsp; Tomkyns and
Chaloner were hanged near their own doors.&nbsp; Tomkyns, when he
came to die, said it was a &ldquo;foolish business;&rdquo; and
indeed there seems to have been no hope that it should escape
discovery; for, though never more than three met at a time, yet a
design so extensive must by necessity be communicated to many who
could not be expected to be all faithful and all prudent.&nbsp;
Chaloner was attended at his execution by Hugh Peters.&nbsp; His
crime was, that he had commission to raise money for the king;
but it appears not that the money was to be expended upon the
advancement of either Crispe&rsquo;s or Waller&rsquo;s plot.</p>
<p>The Earl of Northumberland, being too great for prosecution,
was only once examined before the Lords.&nbsp; The Earl of
Portland and Lord Conway persisting to deny the charge, and no
testimony but Waller&rsquo;s yet appearing against them, were,
after a long imprisonment, admitted to bail.&nbsp; Hassel, the
king&rsquo;s messenger, who carried the letters to Oxford, died
the night before his trial.&nbsp; Hampden [Alexander] escaped
death, perhaps by the interest of his family; but was kept in
prison to the end of his life.&nbsp; They whose names were
inserted in the commission of array were not capitally punished,
as it could not be proved that they had consented to their own
nomination; but they were considered as malignants, and their
estates were seized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waller, though confessedly,&rdquo; says Clarendon,
&ldquo;the most guilty, with incredible dissimulation affected
such a remorse of conscience, that his trial was put off, out of
Christian compassion, till he might recover his
understanding.&rdquo;&nbsp; What use he made of this interval,
with what liberality and success he distributed flattery and
money, and how, when he was brought (July 4) before the House, he
confessed and lamented, and submitted and implored, may be read
in the &ldquo;History of the Rebellion&rdquo; (B. vii.).&nbsp;
The speech, to which Clarendon ascribes the preservation of his
&ldquo;dear-bought life,&rdquo; is inserted in his works.&nbsp;
The great historian, however, seems to have been mistaken in
relating that &ldquo;he prevailed&rdquo; in the principal part of
his supplication, &ldquo;not to be tried by a council of
war;&rdquo; for, according to Whitelock, he was by expulsion from
the House abandoned to the tribunal which he so much dreaded,
and, being tried and condemned, was reprieved by Essex; but after
a year&rsquo;s imprisonment, in which time resentment grew less
acrimonious, paying a fine of ten thousand pounds, he was
permitted to &ldquo;recollect himself in another
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of his behaviour in this part of life, it is not necessary to
direct the reader&rsquo;s opinion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us
not,&rdquo; says his last ingenious biographer, &ldquo;condemn
him with untempered severity, because he was not a prodigy which
the world hath seldom seen, because his character included not
the poet, the orator, and the hero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the place of his exile he chose France, and stayed some
time at Roan, where his daughter Margaret was born, who was
afterwards his favourite, and his amanuensis.&nbsp; He then
removed to Paris, where he lived with great splendour and
hospitality; and from time to time amused himself with poetry, in
which he sometimes speaks of the rebels, and their usurpation, in
the natural language of an honest man.</p>
<p>At last it became necessary, for his support, to sell his
wife&rsquo;s jewels; and being reduced, as he said, at last
&ldquo;to the rump-jewel,&rdquo; he solicited from Cromwell
permission to return, and obtained it by the interest of Colonel
Scroop, to whom his sister was married.&nbsp; Upon the remains of
a fortune, which the danger of his life had very much diminished,
he lived at Hallbarn, a house built by himself very near to
Beaconsfield, where his mother resided.&nbsp; His mother, though
related to Cromwell and Hampden, was zealous for the royal cause,
and, when Cromwell visited her, used to reproach him; he, in
return, would throw a napkin at her, and say he would not dispute
with his aunt; but finding in time that she acted for the king,
as well as talked, he made her a prisoner to her own daughter, in
her own house.&nbsp; If he would do anything, he could not do
less.</p>
<p>Cromwell, now Protector, received Waller, as his kinsman, to
familiar conversation.&nbsp; Waller, as he used to relate, found
him sufficiently versed in ancient history; and, when any of his
enthusiastic friends came to advise or consult him, could
sometimes overhear him discoursing in the cant of the times: but,
when he returned, he would say, &ldquo;Cousin Waller, I must talk
to these men in their own way;&rdquo; and resumed the common
style of conversation.</p>
<p>He repaid the Protector for his favours (1654) by the famous
Panegyric, which has been always considered as the first of his
poetical productions.&nbsp; His choice of encomiastic topics is
very judicious; for he considers Cromwell in his exaltation,
without inquiring how he attained it; there is consequently no
mention of the rebel or the regicide.&nbsp; All the former part
of his hero&rsquo;s life is veiled with shades; and nothing is
brought to view but the chief, the governor, the defender of
England&rsquo;s honour, and the enlarger of her dominion.&nbsp;
The act of violence by which he obtained the supreme power is
lightly treated, and decently justified.&nbsp; It was certainly
to be desired that the detestable band should be dissolved, which
had destroyed the Church, murdered the king, and filled the
nation with tumult and oppression; yet Cromwell had not the right
of dissolving them, for all that he had before done could be
justified only by supposing them invested with lawful
authority.&nbsp; But combinations of wickedness would overwhelm
the world by the advantage which licentious principles afford,
did not those, who have long practised perfidy, grow faithless to
each other.</p>
<p>In the poem on the War with Spain are some passages at least
equal to the best parts of the Panegyric; and, in the conclusion,
the poet ventures yet a higher flight of flattery, by
recommending royalty to Cromwell and the nation.&nbsp; Cromwell
was very desirous, as appears from his conversation, related by
Whitelock, of adding the title to the power of monarchy, and is
supposed to have been withheld from it partly by fear of the
army, and partly by fear of the laws, which, when he should
govern by the name of king, would have restrained his
authority.&nbsp; When, therefore, a deputation was solemnly sent
to invite him to the crown, he, after a long conference, refused
it, but is said to have fainted in his coach when he parted from
them.</p>
<p>The poem on the death of the Protector seems to have been
dictated by real veneration for his memory.&nbsp; Dryden and
Sprat wrote on the same occasion; but they were young men,
struggling into notice, and hoping for some favour from the
ruling party.&nbsp; Waller had little to expect; he had received
nothing but his pardon from Cromwell, and was not likely to ask
anything from those who should succeed him.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, the Restoration supplied him with another
subject; and he exerted his imagination, his elegance, and his
melody, with equal alacrity, for Charles the Second.&nbsp; It is
not possible to read, without some contempt and indignation,
poems of the same author, ascribing the highest degree of
&ldquo;power and piety&rdquo; to Charles the First, then
transferring the same &ldquo;power and piety&rdquo; to Oliver
Cromwell; now inviting Oliver to take the Crown, and then
congratulating Charles the Second on his recovered right.&nbsp;
Neither Cromwell nor Charles could value his testimony as the
effect of conviction, or receive his praises as effusions of
reverence; they could consider them but as the labour of
invention, and the tribute of dependence.</p>
<p>Poets, indeed, profess fiction; but the legitimate end of
fiction is the conveyance of truth, and he that has flattery
ready for all whom the vicissitudes of the world happen to exalt
must be scorned as a prostituted mind, that may retain the
glitter of wit, but has lost the dignity of virtue.</p>
<p>The Congratulation was considered as inferior in poetical
merit to the Panegyric; and it is reported that, when the king
told Waller of the disparity, he answered, &ldquo;Poets, Sir,
succeed better in fiction than in truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Congratulation is indeed not inferior to the Panegyric,
either by decay of genius, or for want of diligence, but because
Cromwell had done much and Charles had done little.&nbsp;
Cromwell wanted nothing to raise him to heroic excellence but
virtue, and virtue his poet thought himself at liberty to
supply.&nbsp; Charles had yet only the merit of struggling
without success, and suffering without despair.&nbsp; A life of
escapes and indigence could supply poetry with no splendid
images.</p>
<p>In the first Parliament summoned by Charles the Second (March
8, 1661), Waller sat for Hastings, in Sussex, and served for
different places in all the Parliaments of that reign.&nbsp; In a
time when fancy and gaiety were the most powerful recommendations
to regard, it is not likely that Waller was forgotten.&nbsp; He
passed his time in the company that was highest, both in rank and
wit, from which even his obstinate sobriety did not exclude
him.&nbsp; Though he drank water, he was enabled by his fertility
of mind to heighten the mirth of Bacchanalian assemblies; and Mr.
Saville said, that &ldquo;no man in England should keep him
company without drinking but Ned Waller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The praise given him by St. Evremond is a proof of his
reputation; for it was only by his reputation that he could be
known, as a writer, to a man who, though he lived a great part of
a long life upon an English pension, never consented to
understand the language of the nation that maintained him.</p>
<p>In Parliament, &ldquo;he was,&rdquo; says Burnet, &ldquo;the
delight of the House, and though old, said the liveliest things
of any among them.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, however, is said in his
account of the year seventy-five, when Waller was only
seventy.&nbsp; His name as a speaker occurs often in Grey&rsquo;s
Collections, but I have found no extracts that can be more quoted
as exhibiting sallies of gaiety than cogency of argument.</p>
<p>He was of such consideration, that his remarks were circulated
and recorded.&nbsp; When the Duke of York&rsquo;s influence was
high, both in Scotland and England, it drew, says Burnet, a
lively reflection from Waller, the celebrated wit.&nbsp; He said,
&ldquo;The House of Commons had resolved that the duke should not
reign after the king&rsquo;s death: but the king, in opposition
to them, had resolved that he should reign even in his
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; If there appear no extraordinary
&ldquo;liveliness&rdquo; in this &ldquo;remark,&rdquo; yet its
reception proves its speaker to have been a &ldquo;celebrated
wit,&rdquo; to have had a name which men of wit were proud of
mentioning.</p>
<p>He did not suffer his reputation to die gradually away, which
may easily happen in a long life, but renewed his claim to
poetical distinction from time to time, as occasions were
offered, either by public events or private incidents; and,
contenting himself with the influence of his Muse, or loving
quiet better than influence, he never accepted any office of
magistracy.</p>
<p>He was not, however, without some attention to his fortune,
for he asked from the king (in 1665) the provostship of Eton
College, and obtained it; but Clarendon refused to put the seal
to the grant, alleging that it could be held only by a
clergyman.&nbsp; It is known that Sir Henry Wotton qualified
himself for it by deacon&rsquo;s orders.</p>
<p>To this opposition, the Biographia imputes the violence and
acrimony with which Waller joined Buckingham&rsquo;s faction in
the prosecution of Clarendon.&nbsp; The motive was illiberal and
dishonest, and showed that more than sixty years had not been
able to teach him morality.&nbsp; His accusation is such as
conscience can hardly be supposed to dictate without the help of
malice.&nbsp; &ldquo;We were to be governed by Janizaries instead
of Parliaments, and are in danger from a worse plot than that of
the fifth of November; then, if the Lords and Commons had been
destroyed, there had been a succession; but here both had been
destroyed for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the language of a man
who is glad of an opportunity to rail, and ready to sacrifice
truth to interest at one time, and to anger at another.</p>
<p>A year after the chancellor&rsquo;s banishment, another
vacancy gave him encouragement for another petition, which the
king referred to the Council, who, after hearing the question
argued by lawyers for three days, determined that the office
could be held only by a clergyman, according to the Act of
Uniformity, since the provosts had always received institution as
for a parsonage from the Bishops of Lincoln.&nbsp; The king then
said he could not break the law which he had made; and Dr.
Zachary Cradock, famous for a single sermon, at most for two
sermons, was chosen by the Fellows.</p>
<p>That he asked anything else is not known; it is certain that
he obtained nothing, though he continued obsequious to the court
through the rest of Charles&rsquo;s reign.</p>
<p>At the accession of King James (in 1685) he was chosen for
Parliament, being then fourscore, at Saltash, in Cornwall; and
wrote a Presage of the Downfall of the Turkish Empire, which he
presented to the king on his birthday.&nbsp; It is remarked, by
his commentator Fenton, that in reading Tasso he had early
imbibed a veneration for the heroes of the Holy War, and a
zealous enmity to the Turks, which never left him.&nbsp; James,
however, having soon after begun what he thought a holy war at
home, made haste to put all molestation of the Turks out of his
power.</p>
<p>James treated him with kindness and familiarity, of which
instances are given by the writer of his life.&nbsp; One day,
taking him into the closet, the king asked him how he liked one
of the pictures: &ldquo;My eyes,&rdquo; said Waller, &ldquo;are
dim, and I do not know it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The king said it was the
Princess of Orange.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is,&rdquo; said Waller,
&ldquo;like the greatest woman in the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
king asked who was that; and was answered, Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;you should think
so; but I must confess she had a wise council.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And, Sir,&rdquo; said Waller, &ldquo;did you ever know a
fool choose a wise one?&rdquo;&nbsp; Such is the story, which I
once heard of some other man.&nbsp; Pointed axioms, and acute
replies, fly loose about the world, and are assigned successively
to those whom it may be the fashion to celebrate.</p>
<p>When the king knew that he was about to marry his daughter to
Dr. Birch, a clergyman, he ordered a French gentleman to tell him
that &ldquo;the king wondered he could think of marrying his
daughter to a falling church.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The
king,&rdquo; said Waller, &ldquo;does me great honour in taking
notice of my domestic affairs; but I have lived long enough to
observe that this falling church has got a trick of rising
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took notice to his friends of the king&rsquo;s conduct; and
said that &ldquo;he would be left like a whale upon the
strand.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whether he was privy to any of the
transactions that ended in the revolution is not known.&nbsp; His
heir joined the Prince of Orange.</p>
<p>Having now attained an age beyond which the laws of nature
seldom suffer life to be extended, otherwise than by a future
state, he seems to have turned his mind upon preparation for the
decisive hour, and therefore consecrated his poetry to
devotion.&nbsp; It is pleasing to discover that his piety was
without weakness; that his intellectual powers continued
vigorous; and that the lines which he composed when &ldquo;he,
for age, could neither read nor write,&rdquo; are not inferior to
the effusions of his youth.</p>
<p>Towards the decline of life he bought a small house, with a
little land, at Coleshill; and said &ldquo;he should be glad to
die, like the stag, where he was roused.&rdquo;&nbsp; This,
however, did not happen.&nbsp; When he was at Beaconsfield, he
found his legs grow tumid: he went to Windsor, where Sir Charles
Scarborough then attended the king, and requested him, as both a
friend and physician, to tell him &ldquo;what that swelling
meant.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered Scarborough,
&ldquo;your blood will run no longer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Waller
repeated some lines of Virgil, and went home to die.</p>
<p>As the disease increased upon him, he composed himself for his
departure; and calling upon Dr. Birch to give him the holy
sacrament, he desired his children to take it with him, and made
an earnest declaration of his faith in Christianity.&nbsp; It now
appeared what part of his conversation with the great could be
remembered with delight.&nbsp; He related, that being present
when the Duke of Buckingham talked profanely before King Charles,
he said to him, &ldquo;My lord, I am a great deal older than your
grace and have, I believe, heard more arguments for atheism than
ever your grace did; but I have lived long enough to see there is
nothing in them; and so, I hope, your grace will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He died October 21, 1687, and was buried at Beaconsfield, with
a monument erected by his son&rsquo;s executors, for which Rymer
wrote the inscription, and which I hope is now rescued from
dilapidation.</p>
<p>He left several children by his second wife, of whom his
daughter was married to Dr. Birch.&nbsp; Benjamin, the eldest
son, was disinherited, and sent to New Jersey as wanting common
understanding.&nbsp; Edmund, the second son, inherited the
estate, and represented Agmondesham in parliament, but at last
turned quaker.&nbsp; William, the third son, was a merchant in
London.&nbsp; Stephen, the fourth, was an eminent doctor of laws,
and one of the commissioners for the union.&nbsp; There is said
to have been a fifth, of whom no account has descended.</p>
<p>The character of Waller, both moral and intellectual, has been
drawn by Clarendon, to whom he was familiarly known, with nicety,
which certainly none to whom he was not known can presume to
emulate.&nbsp; It is therefore inserted here, with such remarks
as others have supplied; after which, nothing remains but a
critical examination of his poetry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edmund Waller,&rdquo; says Clarendon, &ldquo;was born
to a very fair estate, by the parsimony, or frugality, of a wise
father and mother; and he thought it so commendable an advantage,
that he resolved to improve it with his utmost care, upon which
in his nature he was too much intent; and in order to that, he
was so much reserved and retired, that he was scarcely ever heard
of, till by his address and dexterity he had gotten a very rich
wife in the city, against all the recommendation and countenance
and authority of the court, which was thoroughly engaged on the
behalf of Mr. Crofts, and which used to be successful, in that
age, against any opposition.&nbsp; He had the good fortune to
have an alliance and friendship with Dr. Morley, who had assisted
and instructed him in the reading many good books, to which his
natural parts and promptitude inclined him, especially the poets;
and at the age when other men used to give over writing verses
(for he was near thirty years when he first engaged himself in
that exercise, at least that he was known to do so), he surprised
the town with two or three pieces of that kind; as if a tenth
Muse had been newly born to cherish drooping poetry.&nbsp; The
doctor at that time brought him into that company which was most
celebrated for good conversation, where he was received and
esteemed with great applause and respect.&nbsp; He was a very
pleasant discourser in earnest and in jest, and therefore very
grateful to all kind of company, where he was not the less
esteemed for being very rich.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had been even nursed in parliaments, where he sat
when he was very young; and so, when they were resumed again
(after a long intermission) he appeared in those assemblies with
great advantage; having a graceful way of speaking, and by
thinking much on several arguments (which his temper and
complexion, that had much of melancholic, inclined him to), he
seemed often to speak upon the sudden, when the occasion had only
administered the opportunity of saying what he had thoroughly
considered, which gave a great lustre to all he said; which yet
was rather of delight than weight.&nbsp; There needs no more be
said to extol the excellence and power of his wit, and
pleasantness of his conversation, than that it was of magnitude
enough to cover a world of very great faults; that is, so to
cover them, that they were not taken notice of to his reproach,
viz., a narrowness in his nature to the lowest degree; an
abjectness and want of courage to support him in any virtuous
undertaking; an insinuation and servile flattery to the height,
the vainest and most imperious nature could be contented with;
that it preserved and won his life from those who most resolved
to take it, and in an occasion in which he ought to have been
ambitious to have lost it; and then preserved him again from the
reproach and the contempt that was due to him for so preserving
it, and for vindicating it at such a price that it had power to
reconcile him to those whom he had most offended and provoked;
and continued to his age with that rare felicity, that his
company was acceptable where his spirit was odious; and he was at
least pitied where he was most detested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such is the account of Clarendon; on which it may not be
improper to make some remarks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was very little known till he had obtained a rich
wife in the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He obtained a rich wife about the age of three-and-twenty; an
age, before which few men are conspicuous much to their
advantage.&nbsp; He was now, however, in parliament and at court;
and, if he spent part of his time in privacy, it is not
unreasonable to suppose that he endeavoured the improvement of
his mind as well as his fortune.</p>
<p>That Clarendon might misjudge the motive of his retirement is
the more probable, because he has evidently mistaken the
commencement of his poetry, which he supposes him not to have
attempted before thirty.&nbsp; As his first pieces were perhaps
not printed, the succession of his compositions was not known;
and Clarendon, who cannot be imagined to have been very studious
of poetry, did not rectify his first opinion by consulting
Waller&rsquo;s book.</p>
<p>Clarendon observes, that he was introduced to the wits of the
age by Dr. Morley; but the writer of his life relates that he was
already among them, when, hearing a noise in the street, and
inquiring the cause, they found a son of Ben Jonson under an
arrest.&nbsp; This was Morley, whom Waller set free at the
expense of one hundred pounds, took him into the country as
director of his studies, and then procured him admission into the
company of the friends of literature.&nbsp; Of this fact
Clarendon had a nearer knowledge than the biographer, and is
therefore more to be credited.</p>
<p>The account of Waller&rsquo;s parliamentary eloquence is
seconded by Burnet, who, though he calls him &ldquo;the delight
of the House,&rdquo; adds, that &ldquo;he was only concerned to
say that which should make him be applauded, he never laid the
business of the House to heart, being a vain and empty, though a
witty man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of his insinuation and flattery it is not unreasonable to
believe that the truth is told.&nbsp; Ascham, in his elegant
description of those whom in modern language we term wits, says,
that they are &ldquo;open flatterers, and private
mockers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Waller showed a little of both, when, upon
sight of the Duchess of Newcastle&rsquo;s verses on the Death of
a Stag, he declared that he would give all his own compositions
to have written them, and being charged with the exorbitance of
his adulation, answered, that &ldquo;nothing was too much to be
given, that a lady might be saved from the disgrace of such a
vile performance.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, however, was no very
mischievous or very unusual deviation from truth; had his
hypocrisy been confined to such transactions, he might have been
forgiven, though not praised: for who forbears to flatter an
author or a lady?</p>
<p>Of the laxity of his political principles, and the weakness of
his resolution, he experienced the natural effect, by losing the
esteem of every party.&nbsp; From Cromwell he had only his
recall; and from Charles the Second, who delighted in his
company, he obtained only the pardon of his relation Hampden, and
the safety of Hampden&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>As far as conjecture can be made from the whole of his
writing, and his conduct, he was habitually and deliberately a
friend to monarchy.&nbsp; His deviation towards democracy
proceeded from his connexion with Hampden, for whose sake he
prosecuted Crawley with great bitterness; and the invective which
he pronounced on that occasion was so popular, that twenty
thousand copies are said by his biographer to have been sold in
one day.</p>
<p>It is confessed that his faults still left him many friends,
at least many companions.&nbsp; His convivial power of pleasing
is universally acknowledged; but those who conversed with him
intimately, found him not only passionate, especially in his old
age, but resentful; so that the interposition of friends was
sometimes necessary.</p>
<p>His wit and his poetry naturally connected him with the polite
writers of his time: he was joined with Lord Buckhurst in the
translation of Corneille&rsquo;s Pompey; and is said to have
added his help to that of Cowley in the original draft of the
Rehearsal.</p>
<p>The care of his fortune, which Clarendon imputes to him in a
degree little less than criminal, was either not constant or not
successful; for having inherited a patrimony of three thousand
five hundred pounds a year in the time of James the First, and
augmented at least by one wealthy marriage, he left, about the
time of the Revolution, an income of not more than twelve or
thirteen hundred; which, when the different value of money is
reckoned, will be found perhaps not more than a fourth part of
what he once possessed.</p>
<p>Of this diminution, part was the consequence of the gifts
which he was forced to scatter, and the fine which he was
condemned to pay at the detection of his plot; and if his estate,
as is related in his life, was sequestered, he had probably
contracted debts when he lived in exile; for we are told, that at
Paris he lived in splendour, and was the only Englishman, except
the Lord St. Albans, that kept a table.</p>
<p>His unlucky plot compelled him to sell a thousand a year; of
the waste of the rest there is no account, except that he is
confessed by his biographer to have been a bad economist.&nbsp;
He seems to have deviated from the common practice; to have been
a hoarder in his first years, and a squanderer in his last.</p>
<p>Of his course of studies, or choice of books, nothing is known
more than that he professed himself unable to read
Chapman&rsquo;s translation of Homer without rapture.&nbsp; His
opinion concerning the duty of a poet is contained in his
declaration, that &ldquo;he would blot from his works any line
that did not contain some motive to virtue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The characters by which Waller intended to distinguish his
writing are sprightliness and dignity; in his smallest pieces, he
endeavours to be gay; in the larger to be great.&nbsp; Of his
airy and light productions, the chief source is gallantry, that
attentive reverence of female excellence which has descended to
us from the Gothic ages.&nbsp; As his poems are commonly
occasional, and his addresses personal, he was not so liberally
supplied with grand as with soft images; for beauty is more
easily found than magnanimity.</p>
<p>The delicacy, which he cultivated, restrains him to a certain
nicety and caution, even when he writes upon the slightest
matter.&nbsp; He has, therefore, in his whole volume, nothing
burlesque, and seldom anything ludicrous or familiar.&nbsp; He
seems always to do his best; though his subjects are often
unworthy of his care.</p>
<p>It is not easy to think without some contempt on an author,
who is growing illustrious in his own opinion by verses, at one
time, &ldquo;To a Lady, who can do anything but sleep, when she
pleases;&rdquo; at another, &ldquo;To a Lady who can sleep when
she pleases;&rdquo; now, &ldquo;To a Lady, on her passing through
a crowd of people;&rdquo; then, &ldquo;On a braid of divers
colours woven by four Ladies;&rdquo; &ldquo;On a tree cut in
paper;&rdquo; or, &ldquo;To a Lady, from whom he received the
copy of verses on the paper-tree, which, for many years, had been
missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Genius now and then produces a lucky trifle.&nbsp; We still
read the Dove of Anacreon, and Sparrow of Catullus: and a writer
naturally pleases himself with a performance, which owes nothing
to the subject.&nbsp; But compositions merely pretty have the
fate of other pretty things, and are quitted in time for
something useful; they are flowers fragrant and fair, but of
short duration; or they are blossoms to be valued only as they
foretell fruits.</p>
<p>Among Waller&rsquo;s little poems are some, which their
excellency ought to secure from oblivion; as, To Amoret,
comparing the different modes of regard with which he looks on
her and Sacharissa; and the verses on Love, that begin,
&ldquo;Anger in hasty words or blows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In others he is not equally successful; sometimes his thoughts
are deficient, and sometimes his expression.</p>
<p>The numbers are not always musical; as,</p>
<blockquote><p>Fair Venus, in thy soft arms<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The god of rage confine:<br />
For thy whispers are the charms<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which only can divert his fierce design.<br />
What though he frown, and to tumult do incline;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou the flame<br />
Kindled in his breast canst tame<br />
With that snow which unmelted lies on thine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He seldom indeed fetches an amorous sentiment from the depths
of science; his thoughts are for the most part easily understood,
and his images such as the superfices of nature readily supplies;
he has a just claim to popularity, because he writes to common
degrees of knowledge; and is free at least from philosophical
pedantry, unless perhaps the end of a song to the Sun may be
excepted, in which he is too much a Copernican.&nbsp; To which
may be added the simile of the &ldquo;palm&rdquo; in the verses
&ldquo;on her passing through a crowd;&rdquo; and a line in a
more serious poem on the Restoration, about vipers and treacle,
which can only be understood by those who happen to know the
composition of the Theriaca.</p>
<p>His thoughts are sometimes hyperbolical and his images
unnatural</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plants admire,<br />
No less than those of old did Orpheus&rsquo; lyre;<br />
If she sit down, with tops all tow&rsquo;rds her bow&rsquo;d,<br
/>
They round about her into arbours crowd;<br />
Or if she walks, in even ranks they stand,<br />
Like some well-marshall&rsquo;d and obsequious band.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another place:</p>
<blockquote><p>While in the park I sing, the listening deer<br />
Attend my passion, and forget to fear:<br />
When to the beeches I report my flame,<br />
They bow their heads, as if they felt the same.<br />
To gods appealing, when I reach their bowers<br />
With loud complaints they answer me in showers.<br />
To thee a wild and cruel soul is given,<br />
More deaf than trees, and prouder than the Heaven!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the head of a stag:</p>
<blockquote><p>O fertile head! which every year<br />
Could such a crop of wonder bear!<br />
The teeming earth did never bring,<br />
So soon, so hard, so large a thing:<br />
Which might it never have been cast,<br />
Each year&rsquo;s growth added to the last,<br />
These lofty branches had supplied<br />
The earth&rsquo;s bold sons&rsquo; prodigious pride:<br />
Heaven with these engines had been scaled,<br />
When mountains heap&rsquo;d on mountains fail&rsquo;d.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes having succeeded in the first part, he makes a
feeble conclusion.&nbsp; In the song of &ldquo;Sacharissa&rsquo;s
and Amoret&rsquo;s Friendship,&rdquo; the two last stanzas ought
to have been omitted.</p>
<p>His images of gallantry are not always in the highest degree
delicate.</p>
<blockquote><p>Then shall my love this doubt displace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gain such trust that I may come<br />
And banquet sometimes on thy face,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But make my constant meals at home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some applications may be thought too remote and
unconsequential; as in the verses on the Lady Dancing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun in figures such as
these<br />
Joys with the moon to play:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the sweet strains they advance,<br />
Which do result from their own spheres;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As this nymph&rsquo;s dance<br />
Moves with the numbers which she hears.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes a thought, which might perhaps fill a distich, is
expanded and attenuated till it grows weak and almost
evanescent.</p>
<blockquote><p>Chloris! since first our calm of peace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was frighted hence, this good we find,<br />
Your favours with your fears increase,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And growing mischiefs make you kind.<br />
So the fair tree, which still preserves<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her fruit, and state, while no wind blows,<br />
In storms from that uprightness swerves;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the glad earth about her strows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With treasure from her yielding boughs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His images are not always distinct; as in the following
passage, he confounds <i>Love</i> as a person with <i>Love</i> as
a passion:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some other nymphs, with colours faint,<br />
And pencil slow, may Cupid paint,<br />
And a weak heart in time destroy;<br />
She has a stamp, and prints the boy;<br />
Can, with a single look, inflame<br />
The coldest breast, the rudest tame.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His sallies of casual flattery are sometimes elegant and
happy, as that in return for the Silver Pen; and sometimes empty
and trifling, as that upon the Card torn by the Queen.&nbsp;
There are a few lines written in the Duchess&rsquo;s Tasso, which
he is said by Fenton to have kept a summer under
correction.&nbsp; It happened to Waller, as to others, that his
success was not always in proportion to his labour.</p>
<p>Of these pretty compositions, neither the beauties nor the
faults deserve much attention.&nbsp; The amorous verses have this
to recommend them, that they are less hyperbolical than those of
some other poets.&nbsp; Waller is not always at the last gasp; he
does not die of a frown, nor live upon a smile.&nbsp; There is,
however, too much love, and too many trifles.&nbsp; Little things
are made too important: and the Empire of Beauty is represented
as exerting its influence further than can be allowed by the
multiplicity of human passions, and the variety of human
wants.&nbsp; Such books, therefore, may be considered as showing
the world under a false appearance, and, so far as they obtain
credit from the young and unexperienced, as misleading
expectation, and misguiding practice.</p>
<p>Of his nobler and more weighty performances, the greater part
is panegyrical: for of praise he was very lavish, as is observed
by his imitator, Lord Lansdowne:</p>
<blockquote><p>No satyr stalks within the hallow&rsquo;d
ground,<br />
But queens and heroines, kings and gods abound;<br />
Glory and arms and love are all the sound.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the first poem, on the danger of the prince on the coast of
Spain, there is a puerile and ridiculous mention of Arion at the
beginning; and the last paragraph, on the cable, is in part
ridiculously mean, and in part ridiculously tumid.&nbsp; The
poem, however, is such as may be justly praised, without much
allowance for the state of our poetry and language at that
time.</p>
<p>The two next poems are upon the king&rsquo;s behaviour at the
death of Buckingham, and upon his Navy.</p>
<p>He has, in the first, used the pagan deities with great
propriety:</p>
<blockquote><p>&rsquo;Twas want of such a precedent as this<br />
Made the old heathens frame their gods amiss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the poem on the Navy, those lines are very noble which
suppose the king&rsquo;s power secure against a second deluge; so
noble, that it were almost criminal to remark the mistake of
&ldquo;centre&rdquo; for &ldquo;surface,&rdquo; or to say that
the empire of the sea would be worth little if it were not that
the waters terminate in land.</p>
<p>The poem upon Sallee has forcible sentiments; but the
conclusion is feeble.&nbsp; That on the Repairs of St.
Paul&rsquo;s has something vulgar and obvious; such as the
mention of Amphion; and something violent and harsh: as,</p>
<blockquote><p>So all our minds with his conspire to grace<br />
The Gentiles&rsquo; great apostle and deface<br />
Those state obscuring sheds, that like a chain<br />
Seem&rsquo;d to confine, and fetter him again:<br />
Which the glad saint shakes off at his command,<br />
As once the viper from his sacred hand.<br />
So joys the aged oak, when we divide<br />
The creeping ivy from his injured side.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the two last couplets, the first is extravagant, and the
second mean.</p>
<p>His praise of the Queen is too much exaggerated; and the
thought, that he &ldquo;saves lovers, by cutting off hope, as
gangrenes are cured by lopping the limb,&rdquo; presents nothing
to the mind but disgust and horror.</p>
<p>Of the Battle of the Summer Islands, it seems not easy to say
whether it is intended to raise terror or merriment.&nbsp; The
beginning is too splendid for jest, and the conclusion too light
for seriousness.&nbsp; The versification is studied, the scenes
are diligently displayed, and the images artfully amplified; but
as it ends neither in joy nor sorrow, it will scarcely be read a
second time.</p>
<p>The panegyric upon Cromwell has obtained from the public a
very liberal dividend of praise, which, however, cannot be said
to have been unjustly lavished; for such a series of verses had
rarely appeared before in the English language.&nbsp; Of the
lines some are grand, some are graceful, and all are
musical.&nbsp; There is now and then a feeble verse; or a
trifling thought; but its great fault is the choice of its
hero.</p>
<p>The poem of the War with Spain begins with lines more vigorous
and striking than Waller is accustomed to produce.&nbsp; The
succeeding parts are variegated with better passages and
worse.&nbsp; There is something too farfetched in the comparison
of the Spaniards drawing the English on by saluting St. Lucar
with cannon, &ldquo;to lambs awakening the lion by
bleating.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fate of the Marquis and his Lady, who
were burnt in their ship, would have moved more, had the poet not
made him die like the Phoenix, because he had spices about him,
nor expressed their affection and their end by a conceit at once
false and vulgar:</p>
<blockquote><p>Alive, in equal flames of love they
burn&rsquo;d,<br />
And now together are to ashes turn&rsquo;d.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verses to Charles, on his return, were doubtless intended
to counterbalance the panegyric on Cromwell.&nbsp; If it has been
thought inferior to that with which it is naturally compared, the
cause of its deficience has been already remarked.</p>
<p>The remaining pieces it is not necessary to examine
singly.&nbsp; They must be supposed to have faults and beauties
of the same kind with the rest.&nbsp; The Sacred Poems, however,
deserve particular regard; they were the work of Waller&rsquo;s
declining life, of those hours in which he looked upon the fame
and the folly of the time past with the sentiments which his
great predecessor Petrarch bequeathed to posterity, upon his
review of that love and poetry which have given him
immortality.</p>
<p>That natural jealousy which makes every man unwilling to allow
much excellence in another, always produces a disposition to
believe that the mind grows old with the body; and that he, whom
we are now forced to confess superior, is hastening daily to a
level with ourselves.&nbsp; By delighting to think this of the
living, we learn to think it of the dead; and Fenton, with all
his kindness for Waller, has the luck to mark the exact time when
his genius passed the zenith, which he places at his fifty-fifth
year.&nbsp; This is to allot the mind but a small portion.&nbsp;
Intellectual decay is doubtless not uncommon; but it seems not to
be universal.&nbsp; Newton was in his eighty-fifth year improving
his chronology, a few days before his death; and Waller appears
not, in my opinion, to have lost at eighty-two any part of his
poetical power.</p>
<p>His Sacred Poems do not please like some of his other works;
but before the fatal fifty-five, had he written on the same
subjects, his success would hardly have been better.</p>
<p>It has been the frequent lamentation of good men that verse
has been too little applied to the purposes of worship, and many
attempts have been made to animate devotion by pious
poetry.&nbsp; That they have very seldom attained their end is
sufficiently known, and it may not be improper to inquire why
they have miscarried.</p>
<p>Let no pious ear be offended if I advance, in opposition to
many authorities, that poetical devotion cannot often
please.&nbsp; The doctrines of religion may indeed be defended in
a didactic poem; and he, who has the happy power of arguing in
verse, will not lose it because his subject is sacred.&nbsp; A
poet may describe the beauty and the grandeur of nature, the
flowers of the spring, and the harvests of autumn, the
vicissitudes of the tide, and the revolutions of the sky, and
praise the Maker for his works, in lines which no reader shall
lay aside.&nbsp; The subject of the disputation is not piety, but
the motives to piety; that of the description is not God, but the
works of God.</p>
<p>Contemplative piety, or the intercourse between God and the
human soul, cannot be poetical.&nbsp; Man, admitted to implore
the mercy of his Creator, and plead the merits of his Redeemer,
is already in a higher state than poetry can confer.</p>
<p>The essence of poetry is invention; such invention as by
producing something unexpected, surprises and delights.&nbsp; The
topics of devotion are few, and being few are universally known;
but, few as they are, they can be made no more; they can receive
no grace from novelty of sentiment, and very little from novelty
of expression.</p>
<p>Poetry pleases by exhibiting an idea more grateful to the mind
than things themselves afford.&nbsp; This effect proceeds from
the display of those parts of nature which attract, and the
concealment of those which repel, the imagination: but religion
must be shown as it is; suppression and addition equally corrupt
it; and such as it is, it is known already.</p>
<p>From poetry the reader justly expects, and from good poetry
always obtains, the enlargement of his comprehension and
elevation of his fancy: but this is rarely to be hoped by
Christians from metrical devotion.&nbsp; Whatever is great,
desirable, or tremendous, is comprised in the name of the Supreme
Being.&nbsp; Omnipotence cannot be exalted; Infinity cannot be
amplified; Perfection cannot be improved.</p>
<p>The employments of pious meditation are Faith, Thanksgiving,
Repentance, and Supplication.&nbsp; Faith, invariably uniform,
cannot be invested by fancy with decorations.&nbsp; Thanksgiving,
the most joyful of all holy effusions, yet addressed to a Being
without passions, is confined to a few modes, and is to be felt
rather then expressed.&nbsp; Repentance, trembling in the
presence of the judge, is not at leisure for cadences and
epithets.&nbsp; Supplication of man to man may diffuse itself
through many topics of persuasion; but supplication to God can
only cry for mercy.</p>
<p>Of sentiments purely religious, it will be found that the most
simple expression is the most sublime.&nbsp; Poetry loses its
lustre and its power, because it is applied to the decoration of
something more excellent than itself.&nbsp; All that pious verse
can do is to help the memory and delight the ear, and for these
purposes it may be very useful; but it supplies nothing to the
mind.&nbsp; The ideas of Christian Theology are too simple for
eloquence, too sacred for fiction, and too majestic for ornament;
to recommend them by tropes and figures, is to magnify by a
concave mirror the sidereal hemisphere.</p>
<p>As much of Waller&rsquo;s reputation was owing to the softness
and smoothness of his numbers, it is proper to consider those
minute particulars to which a versifier must attend.</p>
<p>He certainly very much excelled in smoothness most of the
writers who were living when his poetry commenced.&nbsp; The
poets of Elizabeth had attained an art of modulation, which was
afterwards neglected or forgotten.&nbsp; Fairfax was acknowledged
by him as his model; and he might have studied with advantage the
poem of Davies, which, though merely philosophical, yet seldom
leaves the ear ungratified.</p>
<p>But he was rather smooth than strong; of &ldquo;the full
resounding line,&rdquo; which Pope attributes to Dryden, he has
given very few examples.&nbsp; The critical decision has given
the praise of strength to Denham, and of sweetness to Waller.</p>
<p>His excellence of versification has some abatements.&nbsp; He
uses the expletive &ldquo;do&rdquo; very frequently; and, though
he lived to see it almost universally ejected, was not more
careful to avoid it in his last compositions than in his
first.&nbsp; Praise had given him confidence; and finding the
world satisfied, he satisfied himself.</p>
<p>His rhymes are sometimes weak words: &ldquo;so&rdquo; is found
to make the rhyme twice in ten lines, and occurs often as a rhyme
through his book.</p>
<p>His double rhymes, in heroic verse, have been censured by Mrs.
Phillips, who was his rival in the translation of
Corneille&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pompey;&rdquo; and more faults might be
found were not the inquiry below attention.</p>
<p>He sometimes uses the obsolete termination of verbs, as
&ldquo;waxeth,&rdquo; &ldquo;affecteth;&rdquo; and sometimes
retains the final syllable of the preterite, as
&ldquo;amazed,&rdquo; &ldquo;supposed,&rdquo; of which I know not
whether it is not to the detriment of our language that we have
totally rejected them.</p>
<p>Of triplets he is sparing; but he did not wholly forbear them:
of an Alexandrine he has given no example.</p>
<p>The general character of his poetry is elegance and
gaiety.&nbsp; He is never pathetic, and very rarely
sublime.&nbsp; He seems neither to have had a mind much elevated
by nature nor amplified by learning.&nbsp; His thoughts are such
as a liberal conversation and large acquaintance with life would
easily supply.&nbsp; They had however then, perhaps, that grace
of novelty which they are now often supposed to want by those
who, having already found them in later books, do not know or
inquire who produced them first.&nbsp; This treatment is
unjust.&nbsp; Let not the original author lose by his
imitators.</p>
<p>Praise, however, should be due before it is given.&nbsp; The
author of Waller&rsquo;s Life ascribes to him the first practice
of what Erythr&aelig;us and some late critics call
&ldquo;Alliteration,&rdquo; of using in the same verse many words
beginning with the same letter.&nbsp; But this knack, whatever be
its value, was so frequent among early writers, that Gascoigne, a
writer of the sixteenth century, warns the young poet against
affecting it; Shakespeare, in the &ldquo;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s
Dream,&rdquo; is supposed to ridicule it; and in another play the
sonnet of Holofernes fully displays it.</p>
<p>He borrows too many of his sentiments and illustrations from
the old mythology, for which it is vain to plead the example of
ancient poets; the deities, which they introduced so frequently,
were considered as realities, so far as to be received by the
imagination, whatever sober reason might even then
determine.&nbsp; But of these images time has tarnished the
splendour.&nbsp; A fiction, not only detected but despised, can
never afford a solid basis to any position, though sometimes it
may furnish a transient allusion, or slight illustration.&nbsp;
No modern monarch can be much exalted by hearing that, as
Hercules had his &ldquo;club&rdquo; he has his
&ldquo;navy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But of the praise of Waller, though much may be taken away,
much will remain; for it cannot be denied that he added something
to our elegance of diction, and something to our propriety of
thought; and to him may be applied what Tasso said, with equal
spirit and justice, of himself and Guarini, when, having perused
the Pastor Fido, he cried out, &ldquo;If he had not read Aminta,
he had not excelled it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Waller professed himself to have learned the art of
versification from Fairfax, it has been thought proper to subjoin
a specimen of his work, which, after Mr. Hoole&rsquo;s
translation, will perhaps not be soon reprinted.&nbsp; By knowing
the state in which Waller found our poetry, the reader may judge
how much he improved it.</p>

<h2>MILTON.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> life of Milton has been already
written in so many forms, and with such minute inquiry, that I
might perhaps more properly have contented myself with the
addition of a few notes on Mr. Fenton&rsquo;s elegant abridgment,
but that a new narrative was thought necessary to the uniformity
of this edition.</p>
<p>John Milton was by birth a gentleman, descended from the
proprietors of Milton, near Thame, in Oxfordshire, one of whom
forfeited his estate in the times of York and Lancaster.&nbsp;
Which side he took I know not; his descendant inherited no
veneration for the White Rose.</p>
<p>His grandfather, John, was keeper of the forest of Shotover, a
zealous Papist, who disinherited his son because he had forsaken
the religion of his ancestors.</p>
<p>His father, John, who was the son disinherited, had recourse
for his support to the profession of a scrivener.&nbsp; He was a
man eminent for his skill in music, many of his compositions
being still to be found; and his reputation in his profession was
such, that he grew rich, and retired to an estate.&nbsp; He had
probably more than common literature, as his son addresses him in
one of his most elaborate Latin poems.&nbsp; He married a
gentlewoman of the name of Caston, a Welsh family, by whom he had
two sons, John, the poet, and Christopher, who studied the law
and adhered, as the law taught him, to the king&rsquo;s party,
for which he was a while persecuted; but having by his
brother&rsquo;s interest obtained permission to live in quiet, he
supported himself so honourably by chamber-practice, that, soon
after the accession of King James, he was knighted and made a
judge; but, his constitution being too weak for business, he
retired before any disreputable compliances became necessary.</p>
<p>He had likewise a daughter Anne, whom he married with a
considerable fortune to Edward Philips, who came from Shrewsbury,
and rose in the Crown-office to be secondary: by him she had two
sons, John and Edward, who were educated by the poet, and from
whom is derived the only authentic account of his domestic
manners.</p>
<p>John the poet, was born in his father&rsquo;s house, at the
Spread Eagle, in Bread Street, Dec. 9, 1608, between six and
seven in the morning.&nbsp; His father appears to have been very
solicitous about his education; for he was instructed at first by
private tuition under the care of Thomas Young, who was
afterwards chaplain to the English merchants at Hamburgh, and of
whom we have reason to think well, since his scholar considered
him as worthy of an epistolary elegy.</p>
<p>He was then sent to St. Paul&rsquo;s school, under the care of
Mr. Gill; and removed, in the beginning of his sixteenth year, to
Christ&rsquo;s College, in Cambridge, where he entered a sizar,
Feb. 12, 1624.</p>
<p>He was at this time eminently skilled in the Latin tongue; and
he himself, by annexing the dates to his first compositions, a
boast of which the learned Politian has given him an example,
seems to commend the earliness of his own proficiency to the
notice of posterity.</p>
<p>But the products of his vernal fertility have been surpassed
by many, and particularly by his contemporary Cowley.&nbsp; Of
the powers of the mind it is difficult to form an estimate: many
have excelled Milton in their first essays, who never rose to
works like &ldquo;Paradise Lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At fifteen, a date which he uses till he is sixteen, he
translated or versified two Psalms, 114 and 136, which he thought
worthy of the public eye; but they raise no great expectations:
they would in any numerous school have obtained praise, but not
excited wonder.</p>
<p>Many of his elegies appear to have been written in his
eighteenth year, by which it appears that he had then read the
Roman authors with very nice discernment.&nbsp; I once heard Mr.
Hampton, the translator of Polybius, remark, what I think is
true, that Milton was the first Englishman who, after the revival
of letters, wrote Latin verses with classic elegance.&nbsp; If
any exceptions can be made, they are very few: Haddon and Ascham,
the pride of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, however they may have
succeeded in prose, no sooner attempt verse than they provoke
derision.&nbsp; If we produced anything worthy of notice before
the elegies of Milton, it was perhaps Alabaster&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Roxana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of these exercises, which the rules of the University
required, some were published by him in his maturer years.&nbsp;
They had been undoubtedly applauded; for they were such as few
can form: yet there is reason to suspect that he was regarded in
his college with no great fondness.&nbsp; That he obtained no
fellowship is certain; but the unkindness with which he was
treated was not merely negative.&nbsp; I am ashamed to relate
what I fear is true, that Milton was one of the last students in
either University that suffered the public indignity of corporal
correction.</p>
<p>It was, in the violence of controversial hostility, objected
to him, that he was expelled: this he steadily denies, and it was
apparently not true; but it seems plain, from his own verses to
&ldquo;Diodati&rdquo;, that he had incurred
&ldquo;rustication,&rdquo; a temporary dismission into the
country, with perhaps the loss of a term.</p>
<blockquote><p>Me tenet urbs reflu&acirc; quam Thamesis alluit
und&acirc;,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Meque nec invitum patria dulcis habet.<br />
Jam nec arundiferum mihi cura revisere Camum<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nec dudum <i>vetiti</i> me <i>laris</i> angit
amor.&mdash;<br />
Nec duri libet usque minas preferre magistri,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; C&aelig;teraque ingenio non subeunda meo.<br />
Si sit hoc exilium patrias adiisse penates,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Et vacuum curis otia greta sequi,<br />
Non ego vel <i>profugi</i> nomen sortemve recuso,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; L&aelig;tus et <i>exilii</i> conditione fruor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I cannot find any meaning but this, which even kindness and
reverence can give to the term, &ldquo;vetiti laris,&rdquo;
&ldquo;a habitation from which he is excluded;&rdquo; or how
&ldquo;exile&rdquo; can be otherwise interpreted.&nbsp; He
declares yet more, that he is weary of enduring &ldquo;the
threats of a rigorous master, and something else which a temper
like his cannot undergo.&rdquo;&nbsp; What was more than threat
was probably punishment.&nbsp; This poem, which mentions his
&ldquo;exile,&rdquo; proves likewise that it was not perpetual;
for it concludes with a resolution of returning some time to
Cambridge.&nbsp; And it may be conjectured, from the willingness
with which he has perpetuated the memory of his exile, that its
cause was such as gave him no shame.</p>
<p>He took both the usual degrees: that of bachelor in 1628, and
that of master in 1632; but he left the University with no
kindness for its institution, alienated either by the injudicious
severity of his governors, or his own captious
perverseness.&nbsp; The cause cannot now be known, but the effect
appears in his writings.&nbsp; His scheme of education, inscribed
to Hartlib, supersedes all academical instruction, being intended
to comprise the whole time which men usually spend in literature,
from their entrance upon grammar, till they proceed, as it is
called Masters of Art.&nbsp; And in his discourse &ldquo;on the
likeliest Way to remove Hirelings out of the Church,&rdquo; he
ingeniously proposes that the profits of the lands forfeited by
the act for superstitious uses should be applied to such
academies all over the land where languages and arts may be
taught together that youth may be at once brought up to a
competency of learning and an honest trade, by which means such
of them as had the gift, being enabled to support themselves
(without tithes) by the latter, may, by the help of the former,
become worthy preachers.</p>
<p>One of his objections to academical education, as it was then
conducted, is, that men designed for orders in the church were
permitted to act plays, writhing and unboning their clergy limbs
to all the antic and dishonest gestures of Trincalos, buffoons,
and bawds, prostituting the shame of that ministry which they
had, or were near having, to the eyes of courtiers and
court-ladies, their grooms and mademoiselles.</p>
<p>This is sufficiently peevish in a man, who, when he mentions
his exile from the college, relates, with great luxuriance, the
compensation which the pleasures of the theatre afford him.&nbsp;
Plays were therefore only criminal when they were acted by
academics.</p>
<p>He went to the university with a design of entering into the
church, but in time altered his mind; for he declared, that
whoever became a clergyman, must &ldquo;subscribe slave, and take
an oath withal, which, unless he took with a conscience that
could retch, he must straight perjure himself.&nbsp; He thought
it better to prefer a blameless silence before the office of
speaking, bought and begun with servitude and
forswearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These expressions are, I find, applied to the subscription of
the Articles; but it seems more probable that they relate to
canonical obedience.&nbsp; I know not any of the Articles which
seem to thwart his opinions: but the thoughts of obedience,
whether canonical or civil, raise his indignation.</p>
<p>His unwillingness to engage in the ministry, perhaps not yet
advanced to a settled resolution of declining it, appears in a
letter to one of his friends, who had reproved his suspended and
dilatory life, which he seems to have imputed to an insatiable
curiosity, and fantastic luxury of various knowledge.&nbsp; To
this he writes a cool and plausible answer, in which he
endeavours to persuade him, that the delay proceeds not from the
delights of desultory study, but from the desire of obtaining
more fitness for his task; and that he goes on, &ldquo;not taking
thought of being late, so it gives advantage to be more
fit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he left the University, he returned to his father, then
residing at Horton, in Buckinghamshire, with whom he lived five
years, in which time he is said to have read all the Greek and
Latin writers.&nbsp; With what limitations this universality is
to be understood, who shall inform us?</p>
<p>It might be supposed, that he who read so much should have
done nothing else; but Milton found time to write the
&ldquo;Masque of Comus,&rdquo; which was presented at Ludlow,
then the residence of the Lord President of Wales, in 1634; and
had the honour of being acted by the Earl of Bridgewater&rsquo;s
sons and daughter.&nbsp; The fiction is derived from
Homer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Circe;&rdquo; but we never can refuse to any
modern the liberty of borrowing from Homer:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;a quo ceu fonte
perenni<br />
Vatum Pieriis ora rigantur aquis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His next production was Lycidas, an elegy, written in 1637, on
the death of Mr. King, the son of Sir John King, Secretary for
Ireland in the time of Elizabeth, James, and Charles.&nbsp; King
was much a favourite at Cambridge, and many of the wits joined to
do honour to his memory.&nbsp; Milton&rsquo;s acquaintance with
the Italian writers may be discovered by a mixture of longer and
shorter verses, according to the rules of Tuscan poetry, and his
malignity to the church by some lines which are interpreted as
threatening its extermination.</p>
<p>He is supposed about this time to have written his Arcades;
for while he lived at Horton he used sometimes to steal from his
studies a few days, which he spent at Harefield, the house of the
Countess Dowager of Derby, where the Arcades made part of a
dramatic entertainment.</p>
<p>He began now to grow weary of the country, and had some
purpose of taking chambers in the Inns of Court, when the death
of his mother set him at liberty to travel, for which he obtained
his father&rsquo;s consent, and Sir Henry Wotton&rsquo;s
directions; with the celebrated precept of prudence, <i>i
pensieri stretti</i>, <i>ed il viso sciolto</i>; &ldquo;thoughts
close, and looks loose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1638 he left England, and went first to Paris; where, by
the favour of Lord Scudamore, he had the opportunity of visiting
Grotius, then residing at the French court as ambassador from
Christina of Sweden.&nbsp; From Paris he hasted into Italy, of
which he had with particular diligence studied the language and
literature; and, though he seems to have intended a very quick
perambulation of the country, stayed two months at Florence;
where he found his way into the academies, and produced his
compositions with such applause as appears to have exalted him in
his own opinion, and confirmed him in the hope, that, &ldquo;by
labour and intense study, which,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I take to
be my portion in this life, joined with a strong propensity of
nature,&rdquo; he might &ldquo;leave something so written to
after-times, as they should not willingly let it die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It appears, in all his writings, that he had the usual
concomitant of great abilities, a lofty and steady confidence in
himself, perhaps not without some contempt of others, for
scarcely any man ever wrote so much, and praised so few.&nbsp; Of
his praise he was very frugal; as he set its value high, and
considered his mention of a name as a security against the waste
of time, and a certain preservative from oblivion.</p>
<p>At Florence he could not indeed complain that his merit wanted
distinction.&nbsp; Carlo Dati presented him with an encomiastic
inscription, in the tumid lapidary style; and Francini wrote him
an ode, of which the first stanza is only empty noise; the rest
are perhaps too diffuse on common topics: but the last is natural
and beautiful.</p>
<p>From Florence he went to Sienna, and from Sienna to Rome,
where he was again received with kindness by the learned and the
great.&nbsp; Holstenius, the keeper of the Vatican library, who
had resided three years at Oxford, introduced him to Cardinal
Barberini: and he, at a musical entertainment, waited for him at
the door, and led him by the hand into the assembly.&nbsp; Here
Selvaggi praised him in a distich, and Salsilli in a tetrastich:
neither of them of much value.&nbsp; The Italians were gainers by
this literary commerce; for the encomiums with which Milton
repaid Salsilli, though not secure against a stern grammarian,
turn the balance indisputably in Milton&rsquo;s favour.</p>
<p>Of these Italian testimonies, poor as they are, he was proud
enough to publish them before his poems; though he says, he
cannot be suspected but to have known that they were said <i>non
tam de se</i>, <i>quam supra se</i>.</p>
<p>At Rome, as at Florence, he stayed only two months: a time
indeed sufficient, if he desired only to ramble with an explainer
of its antiquities, or to view palaces and count pictures; but
certainly too short for the contemplation of learning, policy, or
manners.</p>
<p>From Rome he passed on to Naples, in company of a hermit, a
companion from whom little could be expected; yet to him Milton
owed his introduction to Manso, Marquis of Villa, who had been
before the patron of Tasso.&nbsp; Manso was enough delighted with
his accomplishments to honour him with a sorry distich, in which
he commends him for everything but his religion: and Milton, in
return, addressed him in a Latin poem, which must have raised a
high opinion of English elegance and literature.</p>
<p>His purpose was now to have visited Sicily and Greece; but
hearing of the differences between the king and parliament, he
thought it proper to hasten home, rather than pass his life in
foreign amusements while his countrymen were contending for their
rights.&nbsp; He therefore came back to Rome, though the
merchants informed him of plots laid against him by the Jesuits,
for the liberty of his conversations on religion.&nbsp; He had
sense enough to judge that there was no danger, and therefore
kept on his way, and acted as before, neither obtruding nor
shunning controversy.&nbsp; He had perhaps given some offence by
visiting Galileo, then a prisoner in the Inquisition for
philosophical heresy; and at Naples he was told by Manse, that,
by his declarations on religious questions, he had excluded
himself from some distinctions which he should otherwise have
paid him.&nbsp; But such conduct, though it did not please, was
yet sufficiently safe; and Milton stayed two months more at Rome,
and went on to Florence without molestation.</p>
<p>From Florence he visited Lucca.&nbsp; He afterwards went to
Venice; and, having sent away a collection of music and other
books, travelled to Geneva, which he probably considered as the
metropolis of orthodoxy.</p>
<p>Here he reposed as in a congenial element, and became
acquainted with John Diodati and Frederick Spanheim, two learned
professors of divinity.&nbsp; From Geneva he passed through
France; and came home, after an absence of a year and three
months.</p>
<p>At his return he heard of the death of his friend, Charles
Diodati; a man whom it is reasonable to suppose of great merit,
since he was thought by Milton worthy of a poem, entitled
&ldquo;Epitaphium Damonis,&rdquo; written with the common but
childish imitation of pastoral life.</p>
<p>He now hired a lodging at the house of one Russel a tailor in
St. Bride&rsquo;s Churchyard, and undertook the education of John
and Edward Philips, his sister&rsquo;s sons.&nbsp; Finding his
rooms too little, he took a house and garden in Aldersgate
Street, which was not then so much out of the world as it is now;
and chose his dwelling at the upper end of a passage, that he
might avoid the noise of the street.&nbsp; Here he received more
boys, to be boarded and instructed.</p>
<p>Let not our veneration for Milton forbid us to look with some
degree of merriment on great promises and small performance, on
the man who hastens home, because his countrymen are contending
for their liberty, and, when he reaches the scene of action,
vapours away his patriotism in a private boarding-school.&nbsp;
This is the period of his life from which all his biographers
seem inclined to shrink.&nbsp; They are unwilling that Milton
should be degraded to a schoolmaster; but since it cannot be
denied that he taught boys, one finds out that he taught for
nothing, and another that his motive was only zeal for the
propagation of learning and virtue; and all tell what they do not
know to be true, only to excuse an act which no wise man will
consider as in itself disgraceful.&nbsp; His father was alive;
his allowance was not ample; and he supplied its deficiencies by
an honest and useful employment.</p>
<p>It is told, that in the art of education he performed wonders;
and a formidable list is given of the authors, Greek and Latin,
that were read in Aldersgate Street by youth between ten and
fifteen or sixteen years of age.&nbsp; Those who tell or receive
these stories should consider, that nobody can be taught faster
than he can learn.&nbsp; The speed of the horseman must be
limited by the power of his horse.&nbsp; Every man that has ever
undertaken to instruct others can tell what slow advances he has
been able to make, and how much patience it requires to recall
vagrant inattention, to stimulate sluggish indifference, and to
rectify absurd misapprehension.</p>
<p>The purpose of Milton, as it seems, was to teach something
more solid than the common literature of schools, by reading
those authors that treat of physical subjects, such as the
Georgic, and astronomical treatises of the ancients.&nbsp; This
was a scheme of improvement which seems to have busied many
literary projectors of that age.&nbsp; Cowley, who had more means
than Milton of knowing what was wanting to the embellishments of
life, formed the same plan of education in his imaginary
college.</p>
<p>But the truth is, that the knowledge of external nature, and
the sciences which that knowledge requires or includes, are not
the great or the frequent business of the human mind.&nbsp;
Whether we provide for action or conversation, whether we wish to
be useful or pleasing, the first requisite is the religious and
moral knowledge of right and wrong; the next is an acquaintance
with the history of mankind, and with those examples which may be
said to embody truth, and prove by events the reasonableness of
opinions.&nbsp; Prudence and justice are virtues and excellences
of all times and of all places; we are perpetually moralists, but
we are geometricians only by chance.&nbsp; Our intercourse with
intellectual nature is necessary; our speculations upon matter
are voluntary, and at leisure.&nbsp; Physiological learning is of
such rare emergence, that one may know another half his life
without being able to estimate his skill in hydrostatics or
astronomy; but his moral and prudential character immediately
appears.</p>
<p>Those authors, therefore, are to be read at schools that
supply most axioms of prudence, most principles of moral truth,
and most materials for conversation; and these purposes are best
served by poets, orators, and historians.</p>
<p>Let me not be censured for this digression as pedantic or
paradoxical; for, if I have Milton against me, I have Socrates on
my side.&nbsp; It was his labour to turn philosophy from the
study of Nature to speculations upon life; but the innovators
whom I oppose are turning off attention from life to
nature.&nbsp; They seem to think that we are placed here to watch
the growth of plants, or the motions of the stars.&nbsp; Socrates
was rather of opinion that what we had to learn was how to do
good and avoid evil.</p>

<p>Of institutions we may judge by their effects.&nbsp; From this
wonder-working academy I do not know that there ever proceeded
any man very eminent for knowledge: its only genuine product, I
believe, is a small History of Poetry, written in Latin by his
nephew Philips, of which perhaps none of my readers has ever
heard.</p>
<p>That in his school, as in everything else which he undertook,
he laboured with great diligence, there is no reason for
doubting.&nbsp; One part of his method deserves general
imitation.&nbsp; He was careful to instruct his scholars in
religion.&nbsp; Every Sunday was spent upon theology, of which he
dictated a short system, gathered from the writers that were then
fashionable in the Dutch universities.</p>
<p>He set his pupils an example of hard study and spare diet;
only now and then he allowed himself to pass a day of festivity
and indulgence with some gay gentlemen of Gray&rsquo;s Inn.</p>
<p>He now began to engage in the controversies of the times, and
lent his breath to blow the flames of contention.&nbsp; In 1641
he published a treatise of Reformation in two books, against the
Established Church, being willing to help the Puritans, who were,
he says, &ldquo;inferior to the Prelates in learning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hall, Bishop of Norwich, had published an Humble Remonstrance,
in defence of Episcopacy; to which, in 1641, five ministers, of
whose names the first letters made the celebrated word
<i>Smectymnuus</i>, gave their answer.&nbsp; Of this answer a
confutation was attempted by the learned Usher; and to the
confutation Milton published a reply, entitled, &ldquo;Of
Prelatical Episcopacy, and whether it may be deduced from the
Apostolical Times, by virtue of those Testimonies which are
alleged to that purpose in some late Treatises, one whereof goes
under the Name of James, Lord Bishop of Armagh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have transcribed this title to show, by his contemptuous
mention of Usher, that he had now adopted the Puritanical
savageness of manners.&nbsp; His next work was, &ldquo;The Reason
of Church Government urged against Prelacy,&rdquo; by Mr. John
Milton, 1642.&nbsp; In this book he discovers, not with
ostentatious exultation, but with calm confidence, his high
opinion of his own powers, and promises to undertake something,
he yet knows not what, that may be of use and honour to his
country.&nbsp; &ldquo;This,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;is not to be
obtained but by devout prayer to that Eternal Spirit that can
enrich with all utterance and knowledge, and sends out His
seraphim, with the hallowed fire of His altar, to touch and
purify the lips of whom He pleases.&nbsp; To this must be added,
industrious and select reading, steady observation, and insight
into all seemly and generous arts and affairs till which in some
measure be compassed, I refuse not to sustain this
expectation.&rdquo;&nbsp; From a promise like this, at once
fervid, pious, and rational, might be expected the
&ldquo;Paradise Lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He published the same year two more pamphlets, upon the same
question.&nbsp; To one of his antagonists, who affirms that he
was &ldquo;vomited out of the university,&rdquo; he answers in
general terms: &ldquo;The fellows of the college wherein I spent
some years, at my parting, after I had taken two degrees, as the
manner is, signified many times how much better it would content
them that I should stay.&mdash;As for the common approbation or
dislike of that place, as now it is, that I should esteem or
disesteem myself the more for that, too simple is the answerer,
if he think to obtain with me.&nbsp; Of small practice were the
physician who could not judge by what she and her sister have of
long time vomited, that the worser stuff she strongly keeps in
her stomach, but the better she is ever kecking at, and is
queasy; she vomits now out of sickness; but before it will be
well with her, she must vomit with strong physic.&nbsp; The
university, in the time of her better health, and my younger
judgment, I never greatly admired, but now much less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is surely the language of a man who thinks that he has
been injured.&nbsp; He proceeds to describe the course of his
conduct, and the train of his thoughts; and, because he has been
suspected of incontinence, gives an account of his own purity:
&ldquo;That if I be justly charged,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;with
this crime, it may come upon me with tenfold shame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The style of his piece is rough, and such perhaps was that of
his antagonist.&nbsp; This roughness he justifies by great
examples, in a long digression.&nbsp; Sometimes he tries to be
humorous: &ldquo;Lest I should take him for some chaplain in
hand, some squire of the body to his prelate, one who serves not
at the altar only, but at the court-cupboard, he will bestow on
us a pretty model of himself; and sets me out half-a-dozen
phthisical mottoes, wherever he had them, hopping short in the
measure of convulsion fits; in which labour the agony of his wit
having escaped narrowly, instead of well-sized periods, he greets
us with a quantity of thumb-ring posies.&mdash;And thus ends this
section, or rather dissection, of himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such is
the controversial merriment of Milton; his gloomy seriousness is
yet more offensive.&nbsp; Such is his malignity, &ldquo;that hell
grows darker at his frown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father, after Reading was taken by Essex, came to reside
in his house, and his school increased.&nbsp; At Whitsuntide, in
his thirty-fifth year, he married Mary, the daughter of Mr.
Powel, a justice of the peace in Oxfordshire.&nbsp; He brought
her to town with him, and expected all the advantages of a
conjugal life.&nbsp; The lady, however, seems not much to have
delighted in the pleasures of spare diet and hard study; for, as
Philips relates, &ldquo;having for a month led a philosophic
life, after having been used at home to a great house, and much
company and joviality, her friends, possibly by her own desire,
made earnest suit to have her company the remaining part of the
summer, which was granted, upon a promise of her return at
Michaelmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Milton was too busy to much miss his wife; he pursued his
studies, and now and then visited the Lady Margaret Leigh, whom
he has mentioned in one of his sonnets.&nbsp; At last Michaelmas
arrived; but the lady had no inclination to return to the sullen
gloom of her husband&rsquo;s habitation, and therefore very
willingly forgot her promise.&nbsp; He sent her a letter, but had
no answer; he sent more with the same success.&nbsp; It could be
alleged that letters miscarry; he therefore despatched a
messenger, being by this time too angry to go himself.&nbsp; His
messenger was sent back with some contempt.&nbsp; The family of
the lady were Cavaliers.</p>
<p>In a man whose opinion of his own merit was like
Milton&rsquo;s, less provocation than this might have raised
violent resentment.&nbsp; Milton soon determined to repudiate her
for disobedience; and, being one of those who could easily find
arguments to justify inclination, published (in 1644) &ldquo;The
Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce,&rdquo; which was followed by
the &ldquo;Judgment of Martin Bucer concerning Divorce,&rdquo;
and the next year his &ldquo;Tetrachordon, Expositions upon the
four chief Places of Scripture which treat of
Marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This innovation was opposed, as might be expected, by the
clergy, who, then holding their famous assembly at Westminster,
procured that the author should be called before the Lords;
&ldquo;but that house,&rdquo; says Wood, &ldquo;whether approving
the doctrine, or not favouring his accusers, did soon dismiss
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There seems not to have been much written against him, nor
anything by any writer of eminence.&nbsp; The antagonist that
appeared is styled by him, &ldquo;A Serving Man turned
Solicitor.&rdquo;&nbsp; Howel, in his Letters, mentions the new
doctrine with contempt; and it was, I suppose, thought more
worthy of derision than of confutation.&nbsp; He complains of
this neglect in two sonnets, of which the first is contemptible,
and the second not excellent.</p>
<p>From this time it is observed that he became an enemy to the
Presbyterians, whom he had favoured before.&nbsp; He that changes
his party by his humour is not more virtuous than he that changes
it by his interest; he loves himself rather than truth.</p>
<p>His wife and her relations now found that Milton was not an
unresisting sufferer of injuries; and perceiving that he had
begun to put his doctrine in practice, by courting a young woman
of great accomplishments, the daughter of one Doctor Davis, who
was, however, not ready to comply, they resolved to endeavour a
reunion.&nbsp; He went sometimes to the house of one
Blackborough, his relation, in the lane of St.
Martin&rsquo;s-le-Grand, and at one of his usual visits was
surprised to see his wife come from another room, and implore
forgiveness on her knees.&nbsp; He resisted her entreaties for a
while; &ldquo;but partly,&rdquo; says Philips, &ldquo;his own
generous nature, more inclinable to reconciliation than to
perseverance in anger or revenge, and partly the strong
intercession of friends on both sides, soon brought him to an act
of oblivion and a fair league of peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; It were
injurious to omit that Milton afterwards received her father and
her brothers in his own house, when they were distressed, with
other Royalists.</p>
<p>He published about the same time his &ldquo;Areopagitica, a
speech of Mr. John Milton for the liberty of unlicensed
Printing.&rdquo;&nbsp; The danger of such unbounded liberty, and
the danger of bounding it, have produced a problem in the science
of government, which human understanding seems hitherto unable to
solve.&nbsp; If nothing may be published but what civil authority
shall have previously approved, power must always be the standard
of truth; if every dreamer of innovations may propagate his
prospects, there can be no settlement; if every murmurer at
government may diffuse discontent, there can be no peace; and if
every sceptic in theology may teach his follies, there can be no
religion.&nbsp; The remedy against these evils is to punish the
authors; for it is yet allowed that every society may punish,
though not prevent, the publication of opinions which that
society shall think pernicious; but this punishment, though it
may crush the author, promotes the book; and it seems not more
reasonable to leave the right of printing unrestrained because
writers may be afterwards censured, than it would be to sleep
with doors unbolted, because by our laws we can hang a thief.</p>
<p>But whatever were his engagements, civil or domestic poetry
was never long out of his thoughts.</p>
<p>About this time (1645) a collection of his Latin and English
poems appeared, in which the &ldquo;Allegro,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Penseroso,&rdquo; with some others, were first
published.</p>
<p>He had taken a larger house in Barbican for the reception of
scholars; but the numerous relations of his wife, to whom he
generously granted refuge for a while, occupied his rooms.&nbsp;
In time, however, they went away; &ldquo;and the house
again,&rdquo; says Philips, &ldquo;now looked like a house of the
Muses only, though the accession of scholars was not great.&nbsp;
Possibly his having proceeded so far in the education of youth
may have been the occasion of his adversaries calling him
pedagogue and schoolmaster; whereas it is well known he never set
up for a public school, to teach all the young fry of a parish,
but only was willing to impart his learning and knowledge to his
relations, and the sons of gentlemen who were his intimate
friends, and that neither his writings nor his way of teaching
savoured in the least of pedantry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus laboriously does his nephew extenuate what cannot be
denied, and what might be confessed without disgrace.&nbsp;
Milton was not a man who could become mean by a mean
employment.&nbsp; This, however, his warmest friends seem not to
have found; they therefore shift and palliate.&nbsp; He did not
sell literature to all comers at an open shop; he was a
chamber-milliner, and measured his commodities only to his
friends.</p>
<p>Philips, evidently impatient of viewing him in this state of
degradation, tells us that it was not long continued; and, to
raise his character again, has a mind to invest him with military
splendour: &ldquo;He is much mistaken,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;if
there was not about this time a design of making him an
adjutant-general in Sir William Waller&rsquo;s army.&nbsp; But
the new-modelling of the army proved an obstruction to the
design.&rdquo;&nbsp; An event cannot be set at a much greater
distance than by having been only &ldquo;designed, about some
time,&rdquo; if a man &ldquo;be not much mistaken.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Milton shall be a pedagogue no longer; for, if Philips be not
much mistaken, somebody at some time designed him for a
soldier.</p>
<p>About the time that the army was new-modelled (1645), he
removed to a smaller house in Holborn, which opened backward into
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields.&nbsp; He is not known to have
published anything afterwards till the king&rsquo;s death, when,
finding his murderers condemned by the Presbyterians, he wrote a
treatise to justify it, &ldquo;and to compose the minds of the
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made some remarks on the Articles of Peace between Ormond
and the Irish rebels.&nbsp; While he contented himself to write,
he perhaps did only what his conscience dictated; and if he did
not very vigilantly watch the influence of his own passions, and
the gradual prevalence of opinions, first willingly admitted, and
then habitually indulged; if objections, by being overlooked,
were forgotten, and desire superinduced conviction, he yet
shared&mdash;only the common weakness of mankind, and might be no
less sincere than his opponents.&nbsp; But, as faction seldom
leaves a man honest, however it might find him, Milton is
suspected of having interpolated the book called &ldquo;Icon
Basilike,&rdquo; which the council of state, to whom he was now
made Latin Secretary, employed him to censure, by inserting a
prayer taken from Sidney&rsquo;s &ldquo;Arcadia,&rdquo; and
imputing it to the king, whom he charges, in his
&ldquo;Iconoclastes,&rdquo; with the use of this prayer, as with
a heavy come, in the indecent language with which prosperity had
emboldened the advocates for rebellion to insult all that is
venerable or great: &ldquo;Who would have imagined so little fear
in him of the true all-seeing deity&mdash;as, immediately before
his death, to pop into the hands of the grave bishop that
attended him, as a special relic of his saintly exercises, a
prayer stolen word for word from the mouth of a heathen woman
praying to a heathen god?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The papers which the king gave to Dr. Juxon on the scaffold
the regicides took away; so that they were at least the
publishers of this prayer; and Dr. Birch, who had examined the
question with great care, was inclined to think them the
forgers.&nbsp; The use of it by adaptation was innocent, and they
who could so noisily censure it, with a little extension of their
malice could contrive what they wanted to accuse.</p>
<p>King Charles the Second, being now sheltered in Holland,
employed Salmasius, professor of polite learning at Leyden, to
write a defence of his father and of monarchy; and, to excite his
industry, gave him, as was reported, a hundred Jacobuses.&nbsp;
Salmasius was a man of skill in languages, knowledge of
antiquity, and sagacity of emendatory criticism, almost exceeding
all hope of human attainment; and having, by excessive praises,
been confirmed in great confidence of himself, though he probably
had not much considered the principles of society or the right of
government, undertook the employment without distrust of his own
qualifications; and, as his expedition in writing was wonderful,
in 1649 published &ldquo;Defensio Regis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this Milton was required to write a sufficient answer;
which he performed (1651) in such a manner, that Hobbes declared
himself unable to decide whose language was best, or whose
arguments were worst.&nbsp; In my opinion, Milton&rsquo;s periods
are smoother, neater, and more pointed; but he delights himself
with teasing his adversary as much as with confuting him.&nbsp;
He makes a foolish allusion of Salmasius, whose doctrine he
considers as servile and unmanly, to the stream of Salmasius,
which, whoever entered, left half his virility behind him.&nbsp;
Salmasius was a Frenchman, and was unhappily married to a
scold.&nbsp; <i>Tu es Gallus</i>, says Milton, <i>et</i>, <i>ut
aiunt</i>, <i>nimium gallinaceus</i>.&nbsp; But his supreme
pleasure is to tax his adversary, so renowned for criticism, with
vicious Latin.&nbsp; He opens his book with telling that he has
used <i>Persona</i>, which, according to Milton, signifies only a
<i>Mask</i>, in a sense not known to the Romans, by applying it
as we apply <i>Person</i>.&nbsp; But as Nemesis is always on the
watch, it is memorable that he has enforced the charge of a
solecism by an expression in itself grossly solecistical, when
for one of those supposed blunders, he says, as Ker, and I think
some one before him, has remarked, &ldquo;<i>propino te
grammatistis tuis vapulandum</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; From
<i>vapulo</i>, which has a passive sense, <i>vapulandus</i> can
never be derived.&nbsp; No man forgets his original trade: the
rights of nations, and of kings, sink into questions of grammar,
if grammarians discuss them.</p>
<p>Milton, when he undertook this answer, was weak of body and
dim of sight; but his will was forward, and what was wanting of
health was supplied by zeal.&nbsp; He was rewarded with a
thousand pounds, and his book was much read; for paradox,
recommended by spirit and elegance, easily gains attention; and
he, who told every man that he was equal to his king, could
hardly want an audience.</p>
<p>That the performance of Salmasius was not dispersed with equal
rapidity, or read with equal eagerness, is very credible.&nbsp;
He taught only the stale doctrine of authority, and the
unpleasing duty of submission; and he had been so long not only
the monarch, but the tyrant of literature, that almost all
mankind were delighted to find him defied and insulted by a new
name, not yet considered as any one&rsquo;s rival.&nbsp; If
Christina, as is said, commended the defence of the people, her
purpose must be to torment Salmasius, who was then at court; for
neither her civil station, nor her natural character, could
dispose her to favour the doctrine, who was by birth a queen, and
by temper despotic.</p>
<p>That Salmasius was, from the appearance of Milton&rsquo;s
book, treated with neglect, there is not much proof; but to a
man, so long accustomed to admiration, a little praise of his
antagonist would be sufficiently offensive, and might incline him
to leave Sweden, from which however he was dismissed, not with
any mark of contempt, but with a train of attendants scarce less
than regal.</p>
<p>He prepared a reply, which, left as it was imperfect, was
published by his son in the year of the Restoration.&nbsp; In the
beginning, being probably most in pain for his Latinity, he
endeavours to defend his use of the word <i>persona</i>; but, if
I remember right, he misses a better authority than any that he
has found, that of Juvenal in his fourth satire:</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;Quid agis cum dira et f&oelig;dior omni<br
/>
Crimine <i>persona</i> est?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Salmasius reproached Milton with losing his eyes in the
quarrel, Milton delighted himself with the belief that he had
shortened Salmasius&rsquo;s life, and both perhaps with more
malignity than reason.&nbsp; Salmasius died at the Spa, Sept. 3,
1653; and, as controvertists are commonly said to be killed by
their last dispute, Milton was flattered with the credit of
destroying him.</p>
<p>Cromwell had now dismissed the parliament by the authority of
which he had destroyed monarchy, and commenced monarch himself,
under the title of Protector, but with kingly and more than
kingly power.&nbsp; That his authority was lawful, never was
pretended; he himself founded his right only in necessity; but
Milton, having now tasted the honey of public employment, would
not return to hunger and philosophy, but, continuing to exercise
his office under a manifest usurpation, betrayed to his power
that liberty which he had defended.&nbsp; Nothing can be more
just than that rebellion should end in slavery; that he, who had
justified the murder of his king, for some acts which seemed to
him unlawful, should now sell his services, and his flatteries,
to a tyrant, of whom it was evident that he could do nothing
lawful.</p>
<p>He had now been blind for some years; but his vigour of
intellect was such, that he was not disabled to discharge his
office of Latin secretary, or continue his controversies.&nbsp;
His mind was too eager to be diverted, and too strong to be
subdued.</p>
<p>About this time his first wife died in childbed, having left
him three daughters.&nbsp; As he probably did not much love her,
he did not long continue the appearance of lamenting her; but
after a short time married Catharine, the daughter of one Captain
Woodcock, of Hackney, a woman doubtless educated in opinions like
his own.&nbsp; She died, within a year, of childbirth, or some
distemper that followed it; and her husband honoured her memory
with a poor sonnet.</p>
<p>The first reply to Milton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Defensio
Populi&rdquo; was published in 1651, called &ldquo;Apologia pro
Rege et Populo Anglicano, contra Johannis Polypragmatici (alias
Miltoni) defensionem destructivam Regis et Populi.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Of this the author was not known; but Milton and his nephew
Philips, under whose name he published an answer so much
corrected by him, that it might be called his own, imputed it to
Bramhal; and, knowing him no friend to regicides, thought
themselves at liberty to treat him as if they had known what they
only suspected.</p>
<p>Next year appeared &ldquo;Regii Sanguinis clamor ad
C&oelig;lum.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of this the author was Peter du Moulin,
who was afterwards prebendary of Canterbury; but Morus, or More,
a French minister, having the care of its publication, was
treated as the writer by Milton, in his &ldquo;Defensio
Secunda,&rdquo; and overwhelmed by such violence of invective,
that he began to shrink under the tempest, and gave his
persecutors the means of knowing the true author.&nbsp; Du Moulin
was now in great danger; but Milton&rsquo;s pride operated
against his malignity; and both he and his friends were more
willing that Du Moulin should escape than that he should be
convicted of mistake.</p>
<p>In this second Defence he shows that his eloquence is not
merely satirical; the rudeness of his invective is equalled by
the grossness of his flattery, <i>Deserimur</i>, <i>Cromuelle tu
solus superes</i>, <i>ad te summa nostrarum rerum</i>,
<i>rediit</i>, <i>in te solo consistit</i>, <i>insuperabili
tu&aelig; virtuti cedimus cuncti</i>, <i>nemine vel
obloquente</i>, <i>nisi qui &aelig;quales in&aelig;qualis ipse
honores sibi qu&aelig;rit</i>, <i>aut digniori concessos
invidet</i>, <i>aut non intelligit nihil esse in societate
hominum magis vel Deo gratum</i>, <i>vel rationi
consentaneum</i>, <i>esse in civitate nihil &aelig;quius</i>,
<i>nihil utilius</i>, <i>quam potiri rerum
dignissimum</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Eum te agnoscunt omnes</i>,
<i>Cromuelle</i>, <i>ea tu civis maximus</i>, <i>et
gloriosissimus</i>, <i>dux publici consilii</i>, <i>exercituum
fortissimorum imperator</i>, <i>pater patri&aelig;
gessisti</i>.&nbsp; <i>Sic tu spontanea bonorum omnium et
animitus missa voce salutaris</i>.</p>
<p>C&aelig;sar, when he assumed the perpetual dictatorship, had
not more servile or more elegant flattery.&nbsp; A translation
may show its servility; but its elegance is less
attainable.&nbsp; Having exposed the unskilfulness or selfishness
of the former government, &ldquo;We were left,&rdquo; says
Milton, &ldquo;to ourselves: the whole national interest fell
into our hands, and subsists only in your abilities.&nbsp; To
your virtue, overpowering and resistless, every man gives way,
except some who, without equal qualifications, aspire to equal
honours, who envy the distinctions of merit greater than their
own, or who have yet to learn, that in the coalition of human
society nothing is more pleasing to God, or more agreeable to
reason, than that the highest mind should have the sovereign
power.&nbsp; Such, sir, are you by general confession; such are
the things achieved by you, the greatest and most glorious of our
countrymen, the director of our public councils, the leader of
unconquered armies, the father of your country; for by that title
doss every good man hail you with sincere and voluntary
praise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next year, having defended all that wanted defence, he found
leisure to defend himself.&nbsp; He undertook his own vindication
against More, whom he declares in his title to be justly called
the author of the &ldquo;Regii Sanguinis Clamor.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
this there is no want of vehemence nor eloquence, nor does he
forget his wonted wit.&nbsp; <i>Morus es</i>? <i>an Momus</i>?
<i>an uterque idem est</i>?&nbsp; He then remembers that Morus is
Latin for a mulberry-tree, and hints at the known
transformation:</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;Poma alba ferebat<br />
Qu&aelig; post nigra tulit Morus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this piece ended his controversies; and he from this time
gave himself up to his private studies and his civil
employment.</p>
<p>As secretary to the Protector he is supposed to have written
the Declaration of the reasons for a war with Spain.&nbsp; His
agency was considered as of great importance; for, when a treaty
with Sweden was artfully suspended, the delay was publicly
imputed to Mr. Milton&rsquo;s indisposition; and the Swedish
agent was provoked to express his wonder that only one man in
England could write Latin, and that man blind.</p>
<p>Being now forty-seven years old, and seeing himself
disencumbered from external interruptions, he seems to have
recollected his former purposes, and to have resumed three great
works which he had planned for his future employment&mdash;an
epic poem, the history of his country, and a dictionary of the
Latin tongue.</p>
<p>To collect a dictionary seems a work of all others least
practicable in a state of blindness, because it depends upon
perpetual and minute inspection and collation.&nbsp; Nor would
Milton probably have begun it, after he had lost his eyes; but,
having had it always before him, he continued it, says Philips,
&ldquo;almost to his dying day; but the papers were so
discomposed and deficient, that they could not be fitted for the
press.&rdquo;&nbsp; The compilers of the Latin dictionary,
printed at Cambridge, had the use of those collections in three
folios; but what was their fate afterwards is not known.</p>
<p>To compile a history from various authors, when they can only
be consulted by other eyes, is not easy, nor possible, but with
more skilful and attentive help than can be commonly obtained;
and it was probably the difficulty of consulting and comparing
that stopped Milton&rsquo;s narrative at the Conquest&mdash;a
period at which affairs were not very intricate, nor authors very
numerous.</p>
<p>For the subject of his epic poem, after much deliberation,
long choosing, and beginning late, he fixed upon &ldquo;Paradise
Lost,&rdquo; a design so comprehensive, that it could be
justified only by success.&nbsp; He had once designed to
celebrate King Arthur, as he hints in his verses to Mansus; but
&ldquo;Arthur was reserved,&rdquo; says Fenton, &ldquo;to another
destiny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It appears, by some sketches of poetical projects left in
manuscript, and to be seen in a library at Cambridge, that he had
digested his thoughts on this subject into one of those wild
dramas which were anciently called Mysteries; and Philips had
seen what he terms part of a tragedy, beginning with the first
ten lines of Satan&rsquo;s address to the Sun.&nbsp; These

<p>Such was his first design, which could have produced only an
allegory or mystery.&nbsp; The following sketch seems to have
attained more maturity.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Adam Unparadised</span>.</h3>
<p>The angel Gabriel, either descending or entering; showing,
since this globe was created, his frequency as much on earth as
in heaven; describes Paradise.&nbsp; Next the Chorus, showing the
reason of his coming to keep his watch in Paradise, after
Lucifer&rsquo;s rebellion, by command from God; and withal
expressing his desire to see and know more concerning this
excellent new creature, man.&nbsp; The angel Gabriel, as by his
name signifying a prince of power, tracing Paradise with a more
free office, passes by the station of the Chorus, and, desired by
them, relates what he knew of man; as the creation of Eve, with
their love and marriage.&nbsp; After this, Lucifer appears; after
his overthrow, bemoans himself, seeks revenge on man.&nbsp; The
Chorus prepare resistance on his first approach.&nbsp; At last,
after discourse of enmity on either side, he departs: whereat the
Chorus sings of the battle and victory in Heaven, against him and
his accomplices: as before, after the first act, was sung a hymn
of the creation.&nbsp; Here again may appear Lucifer, relating
and exulting in what he had done to the destruction of man.&nbsp;
Man next, and Eve, having by this time been seduced by the
serpent, appears confusedly covered with leaves.&nbsp; Conscience
in a shape accuses him; Justice cites him to the place whither
Jehovah called for him.&nbsp; In the meanwhile, the Chorus
entertains the stage, and is informed by some angel the manner of
the fall.&nbsp; Here the Chorus bewails Adam&rsquo;s fall; Adam
then and Eve return; accuse one another; but especially Adam lays
the blame to his wife; is stubborn in his offence.&nbsp; Justice
appears, reasons with him, convinces him.&nbsp; The Chorus
admonishes Adam, and bids him beware of Lucifer&rsquo;s example
of impenitence.&nbsp; The angel is sent to banish them out of
Paradise; but before causes to pass before his eyes, in shapes, a
mask of all the evils of this life and world.&nbsp; He is
humbled, relents, despairs; at last appears Mercy, comforts him,
promises the Messiah; then calls in Faith, Hope, and
Charity;&mdash;instructs him; he repents, gives God the glory,
submits to his penalty.&nbsp; The Chorus briefly concludes.&nbsp;
Compare this with the former draft.</p>
<p>These are very imperfect rudiments of &ldquo;Paradise
Lost;&rdquo; but it is pleasant to see great works in their
seminal state, pregnant with latent possibilities of excellence;
nor could there be any more delightful entertainment than to
trace their gradual growth and expansion, and to observe how they
are sometimes suddenly advanced by accidental hints, and
sometimes slowly improved by steady meditation.</p>
<p>Invention is almost the only literary labour which blindness
cannot obstruct, and therefore he naturally solaced his solitude
by the indulgence of his fancy, and the melody of his
numbers.&nbsp; He had done what he knew to be necessarily
previous to poetical excellence; he had made himself acquainted
with &ldquo;seemly arts and affairs;&rdquo; his comprehension was
extended by various knowledge, and his memory stored with
intellectual treasures.&nbsp; He was skilful in many languages,
and had, by reading and composition, attained the full mastery of
his own.&nbsp; He would have wanted little help from books, had
he retained the power of perusing them.</p>
<p>But while his greater designs were advancing, having now, like
many other authors, caught the love of publication, he amused
himself, as he could, with little productions.&nbsp; He sent to
the press (1658) a manuscript of Raleigh, called &ldquo;The
Cabinet Council;&rdquo; and next year gratified his malevolence
to the clergy, by a &ldquo;Treatise of Civil Power in
Ecclesiastical Cases, and the Means of removing Hirelings out of
the Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oliver was now dead; Richard constrained to resign; the system
of extemporary government, which had been held together only by
force, naturally fell into fragments when that force was taken
away; and Milton saw himself and his cause in equal danger.&nbsp;
But he had still hope of doing something.&nbsp; He wrote letters,
which Toland has published, to such men as he thought friends to
the new commonwealth; and even in the year of the Restoration he
&ldquo;bated no jot of heart or hope,&rdquo; but was fantastical
enough to think that the nation, agitated as it was, might be
settled by a pamphlet, called &ldquo;A Ready and Easy Way to
Establish a Free Commonwealth;&rdquo; which was, however, enough
considered to be both seriously and ludicrously answered.</p>
<p>The obstinate enthusiasm of the commonwealth-men was very
remarkable.&nbsp; When the king was apparently returning,
Harrington, with a few associates as fantastical as himself, used
to meet, with all the gravity of political importance, to settle
an equal government by rotation; and Milton, kicking when he
could strike no longer, was foolish enough to publish, a few
weeks before the Restoration, Notes upon a Sermon preached by one
Griffiths, entitled, &ldquo;The Fear of God and the
King.&rdquo;&nbsp; To these notes an answer was written by
L&rsquo;Estrange, in a pamphlet petulantly called &ldquo;No Blind
Guides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But whatever Milton could write, or men of greater activity
could do, the king was now about to be restored with the
irresistible approbation of the people, he was therefore no
longer secretary, and was consequently obliged to quit the house
which he held by his office; the importance of his writings,
thought it convenient to seek some shelter, and hid himself for a
time in Bartholomew Close, by West Smithfield.</p>
<p>I cannot but remark a kind of respect, perhaps unconsciously
paid to this great man by his biographers: every house in which
he resided is historically mentioned, as if it were an injury to
neglect naming any place that he honoured by his presence.</p>
<p>The king, with lenity of which the world has had perhaps no
other example, declined to be the judge or avenger of his own or
his father&rsquo;s wrongs; and promised to admit into the Act of
Oblivion all except those whom the Parliament should except; and
the Parliament doomed none to capital punishment but the wretches
who had immediately co-operated in the murder of the king.&nbsp;
Milton was certainly not one of them; he had only justified what
they had done.</p>
<p>This justification was indeed sufficiently offensive; and
(June 16) an order was issued to seize Milton&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Defence,&rdquo; and Goodwin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Obstructors of
Justice,&rdquo; another book of the same tendency, and burn them
by the common hangman.&nbsp; The attorney-general was ordered to
prosecute the authors; but Milton was not seized, nor perhaps
very diligently pursued.</p>
<p>Not long after (August 19) the flutter of innumerable bosoms
was stilled by an Act, which the king, that his mercy might want
no recommendation of elegance, rather called an Act of Oblivion
than of Grace.&nbsp; Goodwin was named, with nineteen more, as
incapacitated for any public trust; but of Milton there was no
exception.</p>
<p>Of this tenderness shown to Milton the curiosity of mankind
has not forborne to inquire the reason.&nbsp; Burnet thinks he
was forgotten; but this is another instance which may confirm
Dalrymple&rsquo;s observation, who says, &ldquo;that whenever
Burnet&rsquo;s narrations are examined, he appears to be
mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forgotten he was not; for his prosecution was ordered; it must
be therefore by design that he was included in the general
oblivion.&nbsp; He is said to have had friends in the House, such
as Marvel, Morrice, and Sir Thomas Clarges: and undoubtedly a man
like him must have had influence.&nbsp; A very particular story
of his escape is told by Richardson in his Memoirs, which he
received from Pope, as delivered by Betterton, who might have
heard it from Davenant.&nbsp; In the war between the King and
Parliament, Davenant was made prisoner and condemned to die; but
was spared at the request of Milton.&nbsp; When the turn of
success brought Milton into the like danger, Davenant repaid the
benefit by appearing in his favour.&nbsp; Here is a reciprocation
of generosity and gratitude so pleasing, that the tale makes its
own way to credit.&nbsp; But if help were wanted, I know not
where to find it.&nbsp; The danger of Davenant is certain from
his own relation; but of his escape there is no account.&nbsp;
Betterton&rsquo;s narration can be traced no higher; it is not
known that he hid it from Davenant.&nbsp; We are told that the
benefit exchanged was life for life; but it seems not certain
that Milton&rsquo;s life ever was in danger.&nbsp; Goodwin, who
had committed the same kind of crime, escaped with
incapacitation; and, as exclusion from public trust is a
punishment which the power of Government can commonly inflict
without the help of a particular law, it required no great
interest to exempt Milton from a censure little more than
verbal.&nbsp; Something may be reasonably ascribed to veneration
and compassion; to veneration of his abilities, and compassion
for his distresses, which made it fit to forgive his malice for
his learning.&nbsp; He was now poor and blind; and who would
pursue with violence an illustrious enemy, depressed by fortune
and disarmed by nature?</p>
<p>The publication of the &ldquo;Act of Oblivion&rdquo; put him
in the same condition with his fellow-subjects.&nbsp; He was,
however, upon some pretence now not known, in the custody of the
serjeant in December; and when he was released, upon his refusal
of the fees demanded, he and the serjeant were called before the
House.&nbsp; He was now safe within the shade of oblivion, and
knew himself to be as much out of the power of a griping officer
as any other man.&nbsp; How the question was determined is not
known.&nbsp; Milton would hardly have contended but that he knew
himself to have right on his side.</p>
<p>He then removed to Jewin Street, near Aldersgate Street, and,
being blind and by no means wealthy, wanted a domestic companion
and attendant; and therefore, by the recommendation of Dr. Paget,
married Elizabeth Minshul, of a gentleman&rsquo;s family in
Cheshire, probably without a fortune.&nbsp; All his wives were
virgins; for he has declared that he thought it gross and
indelicate to be a second husband: upon what other principles his
choice was made cannot now be known; but marriage afforded not
much of his happiness.&nbsp; The first wife left him in disgust,
and was brought back only by terror; the second, indeed, seems to
have been more a favourite, but her life was short.&nbsp; The
third, as Philips relates, oppressed his children in his
lifetime, and cheated them at his death.</p>
<p>Soon after his marriage, according to an obscure story, he was
offered the continuance of his employment, and, being pressed by
his wife to accept it, answered, &ldquo;You, like other women,
want to ride in your coach; my wish is to live and die an honest
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; If he considered the Latin secretary as
exercising any of the powers of government, he that had shared
authority, either with the Parliament or Cromwell, might have
forborne to talk very loudly of his honesty; and if he thought
the office purely ministerial, he certainly might have honestly
retained it under the King.&nbsp; But this tale has too little
evidence to deserve a disquisition; large offers and sturdy
rejections are among the most common topics of falsehood.</p>
<p>He had so much either of prudence or gratitude, that he
forbore to disturb the new settlement with any of his political
or ecclesiastical opinions, and from this time devoted himself to
poetry and literature.&nbsp; Of his zeal for learning in all its
parts, he gave a proof by publishing, the next year (1661),
&ldquo;Accidence commenced Grammar;&rdquo; a little book which
has nothing remarkable, but that its author, who had been lately
defending the supreme powers of his country, and was then writing
&ldquo;Paradise Lost,&rdquo; could descend from his elevation to
rescue children from the perplexity of grammatical confusion, and
the trouble of lessons unnecessarily repeated.</p>
<p>About this time, Elwood the Quaker, being recommended to him
as one who would read Latin to him for the advantage of his
conversation, attended him every afternoon except on
Sundays.&nbsp; Milton, who, in his letter to Hartlib, had
declared, that &ldquo;to read Latin with an English mouth is as
ill a hearing as Law French,&rdquo; required that Elwood should
learn and practise the Italian pronunciation, which, he said, was
necessary, if he would talk with foreigners.&nbsp; This seems to
have been a task troublesome without use.&nbsp; There is little
reason for preferring the Italian pronunciation to our own,
except that it is more general; and to teach it to an Englishman
is only to make him a foreigner at home.&nbsp; He who travels, if
he speaks Latin, may so soon learn the sounds which every native
gives it, that he need make no provision before his journey; and
if strangers visit us, it is their business to practise such
conformity to our modes as they expect from us in their own
countries.&nbsp; Elwood complied with the directions, and
improved himself by his attendance; for he relates, that Milton,
having a curious ear, knew by his voice when he read what he did
not understand, and would stop him, and &ldquo;open the most
difficult passages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a short time he took a house in the Artillery Walk, leading
to Bunhill Fields; the mention of which concludes the register of
Milton&rsquo;s removals and habitations.&nbsp; He lived longer in
this place than any other.</p>
<p>He was now busied by &ldquo;Paradise Lost.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whence
he drew the original design has been variously conjectured by men
who cannot bear to think themselves ignorant of that which, at
last, neither diligence nor sagacity can discover.&nbsp; Some
find the hint in an Italian tragedy.&nbsp; Voltaire tells a wild
and unauthorised story of a farce seen by Milton in Italy which
opened thus: &ldquo;Let the Rainbow be the Fiddlestick of the
Fiddle of Heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; It has been already shown, that
the first conception was a tragedy or mystery, not of a
narrative, but a dramatic work which he is supposed to have began
to reduce to its present form about the time (1655) when he
finished his dispute with the defenders of the king.</p>
<p>He long had promised to adorn his native country by some great
performance, while he had yet perhaps no settled design, and was
stimulated only by such expectations as naturally arose from the
survey of his attainments, and the consciousness of his
powers.&nbsp; What he should undertake it was difficult to
determine.&nbsp; He was &ldquo;long choosing, and began
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was obliged to divide his time between his private
studies and affairs of state, his poetical labour must have been
often interrupted; and perhaps he did little more in that busy
time than construct the narrative, adjust the episodes,
proportion the parts, accumulate images and sentiments, and
treasure in his memory, or preserve in writing, such hints as
books or meditation would supply.&nbsp; Nothing particular is
known of his intellectual operations while he was a statesman;
for, having every help and accommodation at hand, he had no need
of uncommon expedients.</p>
<p>Being driven from all public stations, he is yet too great not
to be traced by curiosity to his retirement; where he has been
found by Mr. Richardson, the fondest of his admirers, sitting
before his door in a grey coat of coarse cloth, in warm sultry
weather, to enjoy the fresh air; and so, as in his own room,
receiving the visits of people of distinguished parts as well as
quality.&nbsp; His visitors of high quality must now be imagined
to be few; but men of parts might reasonably court the
conversation of a man so generally illustrious, that foreigners
are reported, by Wood, to have visited the house in Bread Street
where he was born.</p>
<p>According to another account, he was seen in a small house,
neatly enough dressed in black clothes, sitting in a room hung
with rusty green; pale but not cadaverous, with chalkstones in
his hands.&nbsp; He said that, if it were not for the gout, his
blindness would be tolerable.</p>
<p>In the intervals of his pain, being made unable to use the
common exercises, he used to swing in a chair, and sometimes
played upon an organ.</p>
<p>He was now confessedly and visibly employed upon his poem, of
which the progress might be noted by those with whom he was
familiar; for he was obliged, when he had composed as many lines
as his memory would conveniently retain, to employ some friend in
writing them, having, at least for part of the time, no regular
attendant.&nbsp; This gave opportunity to observations and
reports.</p>
<p>Mr. Philips observes, that there was a very remarkable
circumstance in the composure of &ldquo;Paradise Lost,&rdquo;
&ldquo;which I have a particular reason,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;to remember; for whereas I had the perusal of it from the
very beginning, for some years, as I went from time to time to
visit him, in parcels of ten, twenty, or thirty verses at a time
(which, being written by whatever hand came next, might possibly
want correction as to the orthography and pointing), having, as
the Summer came on, not been showed any for a considerable while,
and desiring the reason thereof, was answered, that his vein
never happily flowed but from the autumnal equinox to the vernal;
and that whatever he attempted at other times was never to his
satisfaction, though he courted his fancy never so much; so that,
in all the years he was about this poem, he may be said to have
spent half his time therein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon this relation Toland remarks, that in his opinion Philips
has mistaken the time of the year; for Milton, in his Elegies,
declares, that with the advance of the spring he feels the
increase of his poetical force, <i>redeunt in carmina
vires</i>.&nbsp; To this it is answered, that Philips could
hardly mistake time so well marked; and it may be added, that
Milton might find different times of the year favourable to
different parts of life.&nbsp; Mr. Richardson conceives it
impossible that &ldquo;such a work should be suspended for six
months, or for one.&nbsp; It may go on faster or slower, but it
must go on.&rdquo;&nbsp; By what necessity it must continually go
on, or why it might not be laid aside and resumed, it is not easy
to discover.</p>
<p>This dependence of the soul upon the seasons, those temporary
and periodical ebbs and flows of intellect, may, I suppose,
justly be derided as the fumes of vain imagination.&nbsp;
<i>Sapiens dominabitur astris</i>.&nbsp; The author that thinks
himself weather-bound will find, with a little help from
hellebore, that he is only idle or exhausted.&nbsp; But while
this notion has possession of the head, it produces the inability
which it supposes.&nbsp; Our powers owe much of their energy to
our hopes; <i>possunt quia posse videntur</i>.&nbsp; When success
seems attainable, diligence is enforced; but when it is admitted
that the faculties are suppressed by a cross wind, or a cloudy
sky, the day is given up without resistance; for who can contend
with the course of nature?</p>
<p>From such prepossessions Milton seems not to have been
free.&nbsp; There prevailed in his time an opinion, that the
world was in its decay, and that we have had the misfortune to be
produced in the decrepitude of nature.&nbsp; It was suspected
that the whole creation languished, that neither trees nor
animals had the height or bulk of their predecessors, and that
everything was daily sinking by gradual diminution.&nbsp; Milton
appears to suspect that souls partake of the general degeneracy,
and is not without some fear that his book is to be written in
&ldquo;an age too late&rdquo; for heroic poesy.</p>
<p>Another opinion wanders about the world, and sometimes finds
reception among wise men; an opinion that restrains the
operations of the mind to particular regions, and supposes that a
luckless mortal may be born in a degree of latitude too high or
too low for wisdom or for wit.&nbsp; From this fancy, wild as it
is, he had not wholly cleared his head, when he feared lest the
<i>climate</i> of his country might be <i>too cold</i> for
flights of imagination.</p>
<p>Into a mind already occupied by such fancies, another, not
more reasonable, might easily find its way.&nbsp; He that could
fear lest his genius had fallen upon too old a world, or too
chill a climate, might consistently magnify to himself the
influence of the seasons, and believe his faculties to be
vigorous only half the year.</p>
<p>His submission to the seasons was at least more reasonable
than his dread of decaying nature, or a frigid zone; for general
causes must operate uniformly in a general abatement of mental
power; if less could be performed by the writer, less likewise
would content the judges of his work.&nbsp; Among this lagging
race of frosty grovellers he might still have risen into eminence
by producing something which &ldquo;they should not willingly let
die.&rdquo;&nbsp; However inferior to the heroes who were born in
better ages, he might still be great among his contemporaries,
with the hope of growing every day greater in the dwindle of
posterity.&nbsp; He might still be the giant of the pigmies, the
one-eyed monarch of the blind.</p>
<p>Of his artifices of study, or particular hours of composition,
we have little account, and there was perhaps little to be
told.&nbsp; Richardson, who seems to have been very diligent in
his inquiries, but discovers always a wish to find Milton
discriminated from other men, relates that &ldquo;he would
sometimes lie awake whole nights, but not a verse could he make;
and on a sudden his poetical faculty would rush upon him with an
<i>impetus</i> or <i>&aelig;strum</i>, and his daughter was
immediately called to secure what came.&nbsp; At other times he
would dictate perhaps forty lines in a breath, and then reduce
them to half the number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These bursts of light, and involutions of darkness, these
transient and involuntary excursions and retrocessions of
invention, having some appearance of deviation from the common
train of nature, are eagerly caught by the lovers of a
wonder.&nbsp; Yet something of this inequality happens to every
man in every mode of exertion, manual or mental.&nbsp; The
mechanic cannot handle his hammer and his file at all times with
equal dexterity; there are hours, he knows not why, when <i>his
hand is out</i>.&nbsp; By Mr. Richardson&rsquo;s relation,
casually conveyed, much regard cannot be claimed.&nbsp; That, in
his intellectual hour, Milton called for his daughter &ldquo;to
secure what came,&rdquo; may be questioned; for unluckily it
happens to be known that his daughters were never taught to
write; nor would he have been obliged, as it is universally
confessed, to have employed any casual visitor in disburdening
his memory, if his daughter could have performed the office.</p>
<p>The story of reducing his exuberance has been told of other
authors; and, though doubtless true of every fertile and copious
mind, seems to have been gratuitously transferred to Milton.</p>
<p>What he has told us, and we cannot now know more, is, that he
composed much of this poem in the night and morning, I suppose
before his mind was disturbed with common business; and that he
poured out with great fluency his &ldquo;unpremeditated
verse.&rdquo;&nbsp; Versification, free, like this, from the
distresses of rhyme, must, by a work so long, be made prompt and
habitual; and, when his thoughts were once adjusted, the words
would come at his command.</p>
<p>At what particular times of his life the parts of his work
were written, cannot often be known.&nbsp; The beginning of the
third book shows that he had lost his sight, and the introduction
to the seventh, that the return of the king had clouded him with
discountenance; and that he was offended by the licentious
festivity of the Restoration.&nbsp; There are no other internal
notes of time.&nbsp; Milton, being now cleared from all effects
of his disloyalty, had nothing required from him but the common
duty of living in quiet, to be rewarded with the common right of
protection; but this, which, when he skulked from the approach of
his king, was perhaps more than he hoped, seems not to have
satisfied him; for no sooner is he safe, than he finds himself in
danger, &ldquo;fallen on evil days and evil tongues, and with
darkness and with danger compassed round.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
darkness, had his eyes been better employed, had undoubtedly
deserved compassion; but to add the mention of danger was
ungrateful and unjust.&nbsp; He was fallen indeed on &ldquo;evil
days;&rdquo; the time was come in which regicides could no longer
boast their wickedness.&nbsp; But of &ldquo;evil tongues&rdquo;
for Milton to complain, required impudence at least equal to his
other powers; Milton, whose warmest advocates must allow that he
never spared any asperity of reproach or brutality of
insolence.</p>
<p>But the charge itself seems to be false; for it would be hard
to recollect any reproach cast upon him, either serious or
ludicrous, through the whole remaining part of his life.&nbsp; He
pursued his studies or his amusements, without persecution,
molestation, or insult.&nbsp; Such is the reverence paid to great
abilities, however misused; they, who contemplated in Milton the
scholar and the wit, were contented to forget the reviler of his
king.</p>
<p>When the plague (1665) raged in London, Milton took refuge at
Chalfont, in Bucks; where Elwood, who had taken the house for
him, first saw a complete copy of &ldquo;Paradise Lost,&rdquo;
and, having perused it, said to him, &ldquo;Thou hast said a
great deal upon Paradise Lost; what hast thou to say upon
Paradise Found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next year, when the danger of infection had ceased, he
returned to Bunhill Fields, and designed the publication of his
poem.&nbsp; A licence was necessary, and he could expect no great
kindness from a chaplain of the Archbishop of Canterbury.&nbsp;
He seems, however, to have been treated with tenderness; for,
though objections were made to particular passages, and among
them to the simile of the sun eclipsed in the first book, yet the
licence was granted; and he sold his copy, April 27, 1667, to
Samuel Simmons, for an immediate payment of five pounds, with a
stipulation to receive five pounds more when thirteen hundred
should be sold of the first edition; and again, five pounds after
the sale of the same number of the second edition; and another
five pounds after the same sale of the third.&nbsp; None of the
three editions were to be extended beyond fifteen hundred
copies.</p>
<p>The first edition was ten books, in a small quarto.&nbsp; The
titles were varied from year to year; and an advertisement and
the arguments of the books were omitted in some copies, and
inserted in others.</p>
<p>The sale gave him in two years a right to his second payment,
for which the receipt was signed April 26, 1669.&nbsp; The second
edition was not given till 1674; it was printed in small octave;
and the number of books was increased to twelve, by a division of
the seventh and twelfth; and some other small improvements were
made.&nbsp; The third edition was published in 1678; and the
widow, to whom the copy was then to devolve, sold all her claims
to Simmons for eight pounds, according to her receipt given
December 21, 1680.&nbsp; Simmons had already agreed to transfer
the whole right to Brabazon Aylmer for &pound;25; and Aylmer sold
to Jacob Tonson half, August 17, 1683, and half, March 24, 1690,
at a price considerably enlarged.&nbsp; In the history of
&ldquo;Paradise Lost&rdquo; a deduction thus minute will rather
gratify than fatigue.</p>
<p>The slow sale and tardy reputation of this poem have been
always mentioned as evidences of neglected merit, and of the
uncertainty of literary fame; and inquiries have been made, and
conjectures offered, about the causes of its long obscurity and
late reception.&nbsp; But has the case been truly stated?&nbsp;
Have not lamentation and wonder been lavished on an evil that was
never felt?</p>
<p>That in the reigns of Charles and James the &ldquo;Paradise
Lost&rdquo; received no public acclamations is readily
confessed.&nbsp; Wit and literature were on the side of the
court: and who that solicited favour or fashion would venture to
praise the defender of the regicides?&nbsp; All that he himself
could think his due, from &ldquo;evil tongues&rdquo; in
&ldquo;evil days,&rdquo; was that reverential silence which was
generously preserved.&nbsp; But it cannot be inferred that his
poem was not read, or not, however unwillingly, admired.</p>
<p>The sale, if it be considered, will justify the public.&nbsp;
Those who have no power to judge of past times but by their own,
should always doubt their conclusions.&nbsp; The call for books
was not, in Milton&rsquo;s age, what it is at present.&nbsp; To
read was not then a general amusement; neither traders, nor often
gentlemen, thought themselves disgraced by ignorance.&nbsp; The
women had not then aspired to literature, nor was every house
supplied with a closet of knowledge.&nbsp; Those, indeed, who
professed learning, were not less learned than at any other time;
but of that middle race of students who read for pleasure or
accomplishment, and who buy the numerous products of modern
typography, the number was then comparatively small.&nbsp; To
prove the paucity of readers, it may be sufficient to remark,
that the nation had been satisfied from 1623 to 1664&mdash;that
is, forty-one years&mdash;with only two editions of the works of
Shakespeare, which probably did not together make one thousand
copies.</p>
<p>The sale of thirteen hundred copies in two years, in
opposition to so much recent enmity, and to a style of
versification new to all and disgusting to many, was an uncommon
example of the prevalence of genius.&nbsp; The demand did not
immediately increase; for many more readers than were supplied at
first the nation did not afford.&nbsp; Only three thousand were
sold in eleven years; for it forced its way without assistance;
its admirers did not dare to publish their opinion; and the
opportunities now given of attracting notice by advertisements
were then very few; the means of proclaiming the publication of
new books have been produced by that general literature which now
pervades the nation through all its ranks.&nbsp; But the
reputation and price of the copy still advanced, till the
Revolution put an end to the secrecy of love, and &ldquo;Paradise
Lost&rdquo; broke into open view with sufficient security of kind
reception.</p>
<p>Fancy can hardly forbear to conjecture with what temper Milton
surveyed the silent progress of his work, and marked its
reputation stealing its way in a kind of subterraneous current
through fear and silence.&nbsp; I cannot but conceive him calm
and confident, little disappointed, not at all dejected, relying
on his own merit with steady consciousness, and waiting without
impatience the vicissitudes of opinion, and the impartiality of a
future generation.</p>
<p>In the meantime he continued his studies, and supplied the
want of sight by a very odd expedient, of which Phillips gives
the following account:&mdash;</p>
<p>Mr. Philips tells us, &ldquo;that though our author had daily
about him one or other to read, some persons of man&rsquo;s
estate, who, of their own accord, greedily catched at the
opportunity of being his readers, that they might as well reap
the benefit of what they read to him, as oblige him by the
benefit of their reading; and others of younger years were sent
by their parents to the same end; yet excusing only the eldest
daughter by reason of her bodily infirmity and difficult
utterance of speech (which, to say truth, I doubt was the
principal cause of excusing her), the other two were condemned to
the performance of reading and exactly pronouncing of all the
languages of whatever book he should, at one time or other, think
fit to peruse, viz., the Hebrew (and I think the Syriac), the
Greek, the Latin, the Italian, Spanish, and French.&nbsp; All
which sorts of books to be confined to read, without
understanding one word, must needs be a trial of patience almost
beyond endurance.&nbsp; Yet it was endured by both for a long
time, though the irksomeness of this employment could not be
always concealed, but broke out more and more into expressions of
uneasiness; so that at length they were all, even the eldest
also, sent out to learn some curious and ingenious sorts of
manufacture, that are proper for women to learn, particularly
embroideries in gold or silver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the scene of misery which this mode of intellectual labour
sets before our eyes, it is hard to determine whether the
daughters or the father are most to be lamented.&nbsp; A language
not understood can never be so read as to give pleasure, and very
seldom so as to convey meaning.&nbsp; If few men would have had
resolution, to write books with such embarrassments, few likewise
would have wanted ability to find some better expedient.</p>
<p>Three years after his &ldquo;Paradise Lost&rdquo; (1667) he
published his &ldquo;History of England,&rdquo; comprising the
whole fable of Geoffrey of Monmouth, and continued to the Norman
Invasion.&nbsp; Why he should have given the first part, which he
seems not to believe, and which is universally rejected, it is
difficult to conjecture.&nbsp; The style is harsh; but it has
something of rough vigour, which perhaps may often strike, though
it cannot please.</p>
<p>On this history the licenser again fixed his claws, and before
he could transmit it to the press tore out several parts.&nbsp;
Some censures of the Saxon monks were taken away, lest they
should be applied to the modern clergy; and a character of the
Long Parliament, and Assembly of Divines, was excluded; of which
the author gave a copy to the Earl of Anglesea, and which, being
afterwards published, has been since inserted in its proper
place.</p>
<p>The same year were printed &ldquo;Paradise Regained;&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Samson Agonistes,&rdquo; a tragedy written in
imitation of the ancients, and never designed by the author for
the stage.&nbsp; As these poems were published by another
bookseller, it has been asked whether Simmons was discouraged
from receiving them by the slow sale of the former.&nbsp; Why a
writer changed his bookseller a hundred years ago, I am far from
hoping to discover.&nbsp; Certainly, he who in two years sells
thirteen hundred copies of a volume in quarto, bought for two
payments of five pounds each, has no reason to repent his
purchase.</p>
<p>When Milton showed &ldquo;Paradise Regained&rdquo; to Elwood,
&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is owing to you; for you put
it in my head by the question you put to me at Chalfont, which
otherwise I had not thought of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His last poetical offspring was his favourite.&nbsp; He could
not, as Elwood relates, endure to hear &ldquo;Paradise
Lost&rdquo; preferred to &ldquo;Paradise Regained.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Many causes may vitiate a writer&rsquo;s judgment of his own
works.&nbsp; On that which has cost him much labour he sets a
high value, because he is unwilling to think that he has been
diligent in vain; what has been produced without toilsome efforts
is considered with delight, as a proof of vigorous faculties and
fertile invention; and the last work, whatever it be, has
necessarily most of the grace of novelty.&nbsp; Milton, however
it happened, had this prejudice, and had it to himself.</p>
<p>To that multiplicity of attainments, and extent of
comprehension, that entitled this great author to our veneration,
may be added a kind of humble dignity, which did not disdain the
meanest services to literature.&nbsp; The epic poet, the
controvertist, the politician, having already descended to
accommodate children with a book of rudiments, now, in the last
years of his life, composed a book of logic for the initiation of
students in philosophy; and published (1672) &ldquo;Artis
Logic&aelig; plenior Institutio ad Petri Rami Methodum
concinnata;&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;A new Scheme of Logic,
according to the method of Ramus.&rdquo;&nbsp; I know not
whether, even in this book, he did not intend an act of hostility
against the universities; for Ramus was one of the first
oppugners of the old philosophy, who disturbed with innovations
the quiet of the schools.</p>
<p>His polemical disposition again revived.&nbsp; He had now been
safe so long that he forgot his fears, and published a
&ldquo;Treatise of True Religion, Heresy, Schism, Toleration, and
the Best Means to Prevent the Growth of Popery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this little tract is modestly written, with respectful
mention of the Church of England and an appeal to the Thirty-nine
Articles.&nbsp; His principle of toleration is, agreement in the
sufficiency of the Scriptures; and he extends it to all who,
whatever their opinions are, profess to derive them from the
sacred books.&nbsp; The Papists appeal to other testimonies, and
are therefore, in his opinion, not to be permitted the liberty of
either public or private worship; for though they plead
conscience, &ldquo;we have no warrant,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;to
regard conscience which is not grounded in Scripture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those who are not convinced by his reasons, may perhaps be
delighted with his wit.&nbsp; The term &ldquo;Roman Catholic
is,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;one of the Pope&rsquo;s Bulls; it is
particular universal, or Catholic schismatic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He has, however, something better.&nbsp; As the best
preservative against Popery, he recommends the diligent perusal
of the Scriptures, a duty from which he warns the busy part of
mankind not to think themselves excused.</p>
<p>He now reprinted his juvenile poems, with some additions.</p>
<p>In the last year of his life he sent to the press, seeming to
take delight in publication, a collection of &ldquo;Familiar
Epistles in Latin;&rdquo; to which, being too few to make a
volume, he added some academical exercises, which perhaps he
perused with pleasure, as they recalled to his memory the days of
youth; but for which nothing but veneration for his name could
now procure a reader.</p>
<p>When he had attained his sixty-sixth year, the gout, with
which he had been long tormented, prevailed over the enfeebled
powers of nature.&nbsp; He died by a quiet and silent expiration,
about the 10th of November, 1674, at his house in Bunhill Fields;
and was buried next his father in the chancel of St. Giles at
Cripplegate.&nbsp; His funeral was very splendidly and numerously
attended.</p>
<p>Upon his grave there is supposed to have been no memorial; but
in our time a monument has been erected in Westminster Abbey
&ldquo;To the Author of &lsquo;Paradise Lost,&rsquo;&rdquo; by
Mr. Benson, who has in the inscription bestowed more words upon
himself than upon Milton.</p>
<p>When the inscription for the monument of Philips, in which he
was said to be <i>soli Miltono secundus</i>, was exhibited to Dr.
Sprat, then Dean of Westminster, he refused to admit it; the name
of Milton was, in his opinion, too detestable to be read on the
wall of a building dedicated to devotion.&nbsp; Atterbury, who
succeeded him, being author of the inscription, permitted its
reception.&nbsp; &ldquo;And such has been the change of public
opinion,&rdquo; said Dr. Gregory, from whom I heard this account,
&ldquo;that I have seen erected in the church a statue of that
man, whose name I once knew considered as a pollution of its
walls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Milton has the reputation of having been in his youth
eminently beautiful, so as to have been called the lady of his
college.&nbsp; His hair, which was of a light brown, parted at
the fore-top, and hung down upon his shoulders, according to the
picture which he has given of Adam.&nbsp; He was, however, not of
the heroic stature, but rather below the middle size, according
to Mr. Richardson, who mentions him as having narrowly escaped
from being &ldquo;short and thick.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was vigorous
and active, and delighted in the exercise of the sword, in which
he is related to have been eminently skilful.&nbsp; His weapon
was, I believe, not the rapier, but the back-sword, of which he
recommends the use in his book on education.</p>
<p>His eyes are said never to have been bright; but, if he was a
dexterous fencer, they must have been once quick.</p>
<p>His domestic habits, so far as they are known, were those of a
severe student.&nbsp; He drank little strong drink of any kind,
and fed without excess in quantity, and in his earlier years
without delicacy of choice.&nbsp; In his youth he studied late at
night; but afterwards changed his hours, and rested in bed from
nine to four in the summer and five in the winter.&nbsp; The
course of his day was best known after he was blind.&nbsp; When
he first rose, he heard a chapter in the Hebrew Bible, and then
studied till twelve; then took some exercise for an hour; then
dined, then played on the organ, and sang, or heard another sing,
then studied till six; then entertained his visitors till eight;
then supped, and, after a pipe of tobacco and a glass of water,
went to bed.</p>
<p>So is his life described; but this even tenour appears
attainable only in colleges.&nbsp; He that lives in the world
will sometimes have the succession of his practice broken and
confused.&nbsp; Visitors, of whom Milton is represented to have
had great numbers, will come and stay unseasonably; business, of
which every man has some, must be done when others will do
it.</p>
<p>When he did not care to rise early, he had something read to
him by his bedside; perhaps at this time his daughters were
employed.&nbsp; He composed much in the morning, and dictated in
the day, sitting obliquely in an elbow-chair, with his leg thrown
over the arm.&nbsp; Fortune appears not to have had much of his
care.&nbsp; In the civil wars, he lent his personal estate to the
Parliament; but when, after the contest was decided, he solicited
repayment, he met not only with neglect, but &ldquo;sharp
rebuke;&rdquo; and, having tired both himself and his friends,
was given up to poverty and hopeless indignation, till he showed
how able he was to do greater service.&nbsp; He was then made
Latin Secretary, with two hundred pounds a year; and had a
thousand pounds for his &ldquo;Defence of the
People.&rdquo;&nbsp; His widow, who, after his death, retired to
Nantwich, in Cheshire, and died about 1729, is said to have
reported that he lost two thousand pounds by entrusting it to a
scrivener; and that, in the general depredation upon the Church,
he had grasped an estate of about sixty pounds a year belonging
to Westminster Abbey, which, like other sharers of the plunder of
rebellion, he was afterwards obliged to return.&nbsp; Two
thousand pounds which he had placed in the Excise Office were
also lost.&nbsp; There is yet no reason to believe that he was
ever reduced to indigence.&nbsp; His wants, being few, were
competently supplied.&nbsp; He sold his library before his death,
and left his family fifteen hundred pounds, on which his widow
laid hold, and only gave one hundred to each of his
daughters.</p>
<p>His literature was unquestionably great.&nbsp; He read all the
languages which are considered either as learned or polite:
Hebrew, with its two dialects, Greek, Latin, Italian, French, and
Spanish.&nbsp; In Latin his skill was such as places him in the
first rank of writers and critics; and he appears to have
cultivated Italian with uncommon diligence.&nbsp; The books in
which his daughter, who used to read to him, represented him as
most delighting, after Homer, which he could almost repeat, were
Ovid&rsquo;s &ldquo;Metamorphoses&rdquo; and Euripides.&nbsp; His
Euripides is, by Mr. Cradock&rsquo;s kindness, now in my hands:
the margin is sometimes noted; but I have found nothing
remarkable.</p>
<p>Of the English poets he set most value upon Spenser,
Shakespeare, and Cowley.&nbsp; Spenser was apparently his
favourite; Shakespeare he may easily be supposed to like, with
every other skilful reader; but I should not have expected that
Cowley, whose ideas of excellence were different from his own,
would have had much of his approbation.&nbsp; His character of
Dryden, who sometimes visited him, was, that he was a good
rhymist, but no poet.</p>
<p>His theological opinions are said to have been first
Calvinistical; and afterwards, perhaps when he began to hate the
Presbyterians, to have tended towards Arminianism.&nbsp; In the
mixed questions of theology and government, he never thinks that
he can recede far enough from Popery, or Prelacy; but what
Baudius says of Erasmus seems applicable to him, &ldquo;<i>Magis
habuit quod fugeret</i>, <i>quam quod
sequeretur</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had determined rather what to
condemn, than what to approve.&nbsp; He has not associated
himself with any denomination of Protestants: we know rather what
he was not than what he was.&nbsp; He was not of the Church of
Rome; he was not of the Church of England.</p>
<p>To be of no Church is dangerous.&nbsp; Religion, of which the
rewards are distant, and which is animated only by faith and
hope, will glide by degrees out of the mind, unless it be
invigorated and reimpressed by external ordinances, by stated
calls to worship, and the salutary influence of example.&nbsp;
Milton, who appears to have had a full conviction of the truth of
Christianity, and to have regarded the Holy Scriptures with the
profoundest veneration, to have been untainted by any heretical
peculiarity of opinion, and to have lived in a confirmed belief
of the immediate and occasional agency of Providence, yet grew
old without any visible worship.&nbsp; In the distribution of his
hours, there was no hour of prayer, either solitary or with his
household; omitting public prayers, he omitted all.</p>
<p>Of this omission the reason has been sought upon a supposition
which ought never to be made, that men live with their own
approbation, and justify their conduct to themselves.&nbsp;
Prayer certainly was not thought superfluous by him, who
represents our first parents as praying acceptably in the state
of innocence, and efficaciously after their fall.&nbsp; That he
lived without prayer can hardly be affirmed; his studies and
meditations were an habitual prayer.&nbsp; The neglect of it in
his family was probably a fault for which he condemned himself,
and which he intended to correct; but that death, as too often
happens, intercepted his reformation.</p>
<p>His political notions were those of an acrimonious and surly
Republican; for which it is not known that he gave any better
reason than that &ldquo;a popular government was the most frugal;
for the trappings of a monarchy would set up an ordinary
commonwealth.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is surely very shallow policy that
supposes money to be the chief good; and even this, without
considering that the support and expense of a court is, for the
most part, only a particular kind of traffic, for which money is
circulated, without any national impoverishment.</p>
<p>Milton&rsquo;s Republicanism was, I am afraid, founded in an
envious hatred of greatness, and a sullen desire of independence;
in petulance impatient of control, and pride disdainful of
superiority.&nbsp; He hated monarchs in the State, and prelates
in the Church; for he hated all whom he was required to
obey.&nbsp; It is to be suspected that his predominant desire was
to destroy rather than establish, and that he felt not so much
the love of liberty as repugnance to authority.</p>
<p>It has been observed that they who most loudly clamour for
liberty do not most liberally grant it.&nbsp; What we know of
Milton&rsquo;s character, in domestic relations, is, that he was
severe and arbitrary.&nbsp; His family consisted of women; and
there appears in his books something like a Turkish contempt of
females, as subordinate and inferior beings.&nbsp; That his own
daughters might not break the ranks, he suffered them to be
depressed by a mean and penurious education.&nbsp; He thought
woman made only for obedience, and man only for rebellion.</p>
<p>Of his family some account may be expected.&nbsp; His sister,
first married to Mr. Philips, afterwards married Mr. Agar, a
friend of her first husband, who succeeded him in the Crown
office.&nbsp; She had, by her first husband, Edward and John, the
two nephews whom Milton educated; and by her second, two
daughters.</p>
<p>His brother, Sir Christopher, had two daughters, Mary and
Catharine, and a son, Thomas, who succeeded Agar in the Crown
office, and left a daughter living in 1749 in Grosvenor
Street.</p>
<p>Milton had children only by his first wife: Anne, Mary, and
Deborah.&nbsp; Anne, though deformed, married a master-builder,
and died of her first child.&nbsp; Mary died single.&nbsp;
Deborah married Abraham Clark, a weaver in Spitalfields, and
lived seventy-six years, to August, 1727.&nbsp; This is the
daughter of whom public mention has been made.&nbsp; She could
repeat the first lines of Homer, the &ldquo;Metamorphoses,&rdquo;
and some of Euripides, by having often read them.&nbsp; Yet here
incredulity is ready to make a stand.&nbsp; Many repetitions are
necessary to fix in memory lines not understood; and why should
Milton wish or want to hear them so often?&nbsp; These lines were
at the beginning of the poems.&nbsp; Of a book written in a
language not understood, the beginning raises no more attention
than the end; and as those that understand it know commonly the
beginning best, its rehearsal will seldom be necessary.&nbsp; It
is not likely that Milton required any passage to be so much
repeated as that his daughter could learn it; nor likely that he
desired the initial lines to be read at all; nor that the
daughter, weary of the drudgery of pronouncing unideal sounds,
would voluntarily commit them to memory.</p>
<p>To this gentlewoman Addison made a present, and promised some
establishment, but died soon after.&nbsp; Queen Caroline sent her
fifty guineas.&nbsp; She had seven sons and three daughters; but
none of them had any children, except her son Caleb and her
daughter Elizabeth.&nbsp; Caleb went to Fort St. George, in the
East Indies, and had two sons, of whom nothing now is
known.&nbsp; Elizabeth married Thomas Foster, a weaver in
Spitalfields, and had seven children, who all died.&nbsp; She
kept a petty grocer&rsquo;s or chandler&rsquo;s shop, first at
Holloway, and afterwards in Cock Lane, near Shoreditch
Church.&nbsp; She knew little of her grandfather, and that little
was not good.&nbsp; She told of his harshness to his daughters,
and his refusal to have them taught to write; and, in opposition
to other accounts, represented him as delicate, though temperate,
in his diet.</p>
<p>In 1750, April 5th, <i>Comus</i> was played for her
benefit.&nbsp; She had so little acquaintance with diversion or
gaiety, that she did not know what was intended when a benefit
was offered her.&nbsp; The profits of the night were only one
hundred and thirty pounds, though Dr. Newton brought a large
contribution; and twenty pounds were given by Tonson, a man who
is to be praised as often as he is named.&nbsp; Of this sum one
hundred pounds were placed in the stocks, after some debate
between her and her husband in whose name it should be entered;
and the rest augmented their little stock, with which they
removed to Islington.&nbsp; This was the greatest benefaction
that &ldquo;Paradise Lost&rdquo; ever procured the author&rsquo;s
descendants; and to this he who has now attempted to relate his
Life, had the honour of contributing a Prologue.</p>
<p>In the examination of Milton&rsquo;s poetical works, I shall
pay so much regard to time as to begin with his juvenile
productions.&nbsp; For his early pieces he seems to have had a
degree of fondness not very laudable; what he has once written he
resolves to preserve, and gives to the public an unfinished poem
which he broke off because he was &ldquo;nothing satisfied with
what he had done,&rdquo; supposing his readers less nice than
himself.&nbsp; These preludes to his future labours are in
Italian, Latin, and English.&nbsp; Of the Italian I cannot
pretend to speak as a critic; but I have heard them commended by
a man well qualified to decide their merit.&nbsp; The Latin
pieces are lusciously elegant: but the delight which they afford
is rather by the exquisite imitation of the ancient writers, by
the purity of the diction, and the harmony of the numbers, than
by any power of invention or vigour of sentiment.&nbsp; They are
not all of equal value; the elegies excel the odes; and some of
the exercises on Gunpowder Treason might have been spared.</p>
<p>The English poems, though they make no promises of
&ldquo;Paradise Lost,&rdquo; have this evidence of
genius&mdash;that they have a cast original and unborrowed.&nbsp;
But their peculiarity is not excellence; if they differ from the
verses of others, they differ for the worse; for they are too
often distinguished by repulsive harshness; the combinations of
words are new, but they are not pleasing; the rhymes and epithets
seem to be laboriously sought, and violently applied.</p>
<p>That in the early parts of his life he wrote with much care
appears from his manuscripts, happily preserved at Cambridge, in
which many of his smaller works are found as they were first
written, with the subsequent corrections.&nbsp; Such relics show
how excellence is acquired; what we hope ever to do with ease, we
must learn first to do with diligence.</p>
<p>Those who admire the beauties of this great poet sometimes
force their own judgment into false approbation of his little
pieces, and prevail upon themselves to think that admirable which
is only singular.&nbsp; All that short compositions can commonly
attain is neatness and elegance.&nbsp; Milton never learned the
art of doing little things with grace; he overlooked the milder
excellence of suavity and softness; he was a &ldquo;Lion&rdquo;
that had no skill in &ldquo;dandling the Kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the poems on which much praise has been bestowed is
&ldquo;Lycidas;&rdquo; of which the diction is harsh, the rhymes
uncertain, and the numbers unpleasing.&nbsp; What beauty there is
we must therefore seek in the sentiments and images.&nbsp; It is
not to be considered as the effusion of real passion; for passion
runs not after remote allusions and obscure opinions.&nbsp;
Passion plucks no berries from the myrtle and ivy, nor calls upon
Arethuse and Mincius, nor tells of rough &ldquo;satyrs&rdquo; and
&ldquo;fauns with cloven heel.&rdquo;&nbsp; Where there is
leisure for fiction, there is little grief.</p>
<p>In this poem there is no nature, for there is no truth; there
is no art, for there is nothing new.&nbsp; Its form is that of a
pastoral; easy, vulgar, and therefore disgusting; whatever images
it can supply are long ago exhausted; and its inherent
improbability always forces dissatisfaction on the mind.&nbsp;
When Cowley tells of Hervey, that they studied together, it is
easy to suppose how much he must miss the companion of his
labours, and the partner of his discoveries; but what image of
tenderness can be excited by these lines?&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>We drove afield, and both together heard<br />
What time the grey fly winds her sultry horn,<br />
Battening our flocks with the fresh dews of night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We know that they never drove afield, and that they had no
flocks to batten; and though it be allowed that the
representation may be allegorical, the true meaning is so
uncertain and remote, that it is never sought, because it cannot
be known when it is found.</p>
<p>Among the flocks, and copses, and flowers, appear the heathen
deities; Jove and Ph&oelig;bus, Neptune and &AElig;olus, with a
long train of mythological imagery, such as a college easily
supplies.&nbsp; Nothing can less display knowledge, or less
exercise invention, than to tell how a shepherd has lost his
companion, and must now feed his flocks alone, without any judge
of his skill in piping; and how one god asks another god what is
become of Lycidas, and how neither god can tell.&nbsp; He who
thus grieves will excite no sympathy; he who thus praises will
confer no honour.</p>
<p>This poem has yet a grosser fault.&nbsp; With these trifling
fictions are mingled the most awful and sacred truths, such as
ought never to be polluted with such irreverent
combinations.&nbsp; The shepherd likewise is now a feeder of
sheep, and afterwards an ecclesiastical pastor, a superintendent
of a Christian flock.&nbsp; Such equivocations are always
unskilful; but here they are indecent, and at least approach to
impiety, of which, however, I believe the writer not to have been
conscious.</p>
<p>Such is the power of reputation justly acquired, that its
blaze drives away the eye from nice examination.&nbsp; Surely no
man could have fancied that he read Lycidas with pleasure, had he
not known the author.</p>
<p>Of the two pieces, &ldquo;L&rsquo;Allegro&rdquo; and &ldquo;il
Penseroso,&rdquo; I believe, opinion is uniform; every man that
reads them, reads them with pleasure.&nbsp; The author&rsquo;s
design is not, what Theobald has remarked, merely to show how
objects derive their colours from the mind, by representing the
operation of the same things upon the gay and the melancholy
temper, or upon the same man as he is differently disposed; but
rather how, among the successive variety of appearances, every
disposition of mind takes hold on those by which it may be
gratified.</p>
<p>The <i>cheerful</i> man hears the lark in the morning; the
<i>pensive</i> man hears the nightingale in the evening.&nbsp;
The <i>cheerful</i> man sees the cock strut, and hears the horn
and hounds echo in the wood; then walks, <i>not unseen</i>, to
observe the glory of the rising sun, or listen to the singing
milkmaid, and view the labours of the ploughman and the mower;
then casts his eyes about him over scenes of smiling plenty, and
looks up to the distant tower, the residence of some fair
inhabitant; thus he pursues real gaiety through a day of labour
or of play, and delights himself at night with the fanciful
narratives of superstitious ignorance.</p>
<p>The <i>pensive</i> man at one time walks <i>unseen</i> to muse
at midnight, and at another hears the sullen curfew.&nbsp; If the
weather drives him home, he sits in a room lighted only by
&ldquo;glowing embers;&rdquo; or by a lonely lamp outwatches the
North Star, to discover the habitation of separate souls, and
varies the Shades of meditation by contemplating the magnificent
or pathetic scenes of tragic and epic poetry.&nbsp; When the
morning comes&mdash;a morning gloomy with rain and wind&mdash;he
walks into the dark, trackless woods, falls asleep by some
murmuring water, and with melancholy enthusiasm expects some
dream of prognostication, or some music played by a&euml;rial
performers.</p>
<p>Both mirth and melancholy are solitary, silent inhabitants of
the breast, that neither receive nor transmit communication; no
mention is therefore made of a philosophical friend, or a
pleasant companion.&nbsp; The seriousness does not arise from any
participation of calamity, nor the gaiety from the pleasures of
the bottle.</p>
<p>The man of <i>cheerfulness</i>, having exhausted the country,
tries what &ldquo;towered cities&rdquo; will afford, and mingles
with scenes of splendour, gay assemblies, and nuptial
festivities; but he mingles a mere spectator, as, when the
learned comedies of Jonson, or the wild dramas of Shakespeare,
are exhibited, he attends the theatre.</p>
<p>The <i>pensive</i> man never loses himself in crowds, but
walks the cloister, or frequents the cathedral.&nbsp; Milton
probably had not yet forsaken the Church.</p>
<p>Both his characters delight in music; but he seems to think
that cheerful notes would have obtained from Pluto a complete
dismission of Eurydice, of whom solemn sounds procured only a
conditional release.</p>
<p>For the old age of Cheerfulness he makes no provision: but
Melancholy he conducts with great dignity to the close of
life.&nbsp; His Cheerfulness is without levity, and his
Pensiveness without asperity.</p>
<p>Through these two poems the images are properly selected and
nicely distinguished; but the colours of the diction seem not
sufficiently discriminated.&nbsp; I know not whether the
characters are kept sufficiently apart.&nbsp; No mirth can,
indeed, be found in his melancholy; but I am afraid that I always
meet some melancholy in his mirth.&nbsp; They are two noble
efforts of imagination.</p>
<p>The greatest of his juvenile performances is the &ldquo;Mask
of <i>Comus</i>,&rdquo; in which may very plainly be discovered
the dawn or twilight of &ldquo;Paradise Lost.&rdquo;&nbsp; Milton
appears to have formed very early that system of diction, and
mode of verse, which his maturer judgment approved, and from
which he never endeavoured nor desired to deviate.</p>
<p>Nor does <i>Comus</i> afford only a specimen of his language;
it exhibits likewise his power of description and his vigour of
sentiment, employed in the praise and defence of virtue.&nbsp; A
work more truly poetical is rarely found; allusions, images, and
descriptive epithets, embellish almost every period with lavish
decoration.&nbsp; As a series of lines, therefore, it may be
considered as worthy of all the admiration with which the
votaries have received it.</p>
<p>As a drama it is deficient.&nbsp; The action is not
probable.&nbsp; A mask, in those parts where supernatural
intervention is admitted, must indeed be given up to all the
freaks of imagination, but so far as the action is merely human,
it ought to be reasonable, which can hardly be said of the
conduct of the two brothers; who, when their sister sinks with
fatigue in a pathless wilderness, wander both away together in
search of berries too far to find their way back, and leave a
helpless lady to all the sadness and danger of solitude.&nbsp;
This, however, is a defect over-balanced by its convenience.</p>
<p>What deserves more reprehension is, that the prologue spoken
in the wild wood by the attendant Spirit is addressed to the
audience; a mode of communication so contrary to the nature of
dramatic representation, that no precedents can support it.</p>
<p>The discourse of the Spirit is too long; an objection that may
be made to almost all the following speeches; they have not the
sprightliness of a dialogue animated by reciprocal contention,
but seem rather declamations deliberately composed, and formally
repeated, on a moral question.&nbsp; The auditor therefore
listens as to a lecture, without passion, without anxiety.</p>
<p>The song of Comus has airiness and jollity; but, what may
recommend Milton&rsquo;s morals as well as his poetry, the
invitations to pleasure are so general, that they excite no
distinct images of corrupt enjoyment, and take no dangerous hold
on the fancy.</p>
<p>The following soliloquies of Comus and the Lady are elegant
but tedious.&nbsp; The song must owe much to the voice if it ever
can delight.&nbsp; At last the Brothers enter with too much
tranquillity; and, when they have feared lest their Sister should
be in danger, and hoped that she is not in danger, the elder
makes a speech in praise of chastity, and the younger finds how
fine it is to be a philosopher.</p>
<p>Then descends the Spirit in form of a shepherd; and the
Brother, instead of being in haste to ask his help, praises his
singing, and inquires his business in that place.&nbsp; It is
remarkable, that at this interview the Brother is taken with a
short fit of rhyming, The Spirit relates that the Lady is in the
power of Comus; the Brother moralises again; and the Spirit makes
a long narration, of no use because it is false, and therefore
unsuitable to a good being.</p>
<p>In all these parts the language is poetical, and the
sentiments are generous; but there is something wanting to allure
attention.</p>
<p>The dispute between the Lady and Comus is the most animated
and affecting scene of the drama, and wants nothing but a brisker
reciprocation of objections and replies to invite attention, and
detain it.</p>
<p>The songs are vigorous and full of imagery; but they are harsh
in their diction, and not very musical in their numbers.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole the figures are too bold, and the
language too luxuriant for dialogue.&nbsp; It is a drama in the
epic style, inelegantly splendid, and tediously instructive.</p>
<p>The sonnets were written in different parts of Milton&rsquo;s
life, upon different occasions.&nbsp; They deserve not any
particular criticism; for of the best it can only be said, that
they are not bad; and perhaps only the eighth and twenty-first
are truly entitled to this slender commendation.&nbsp; The fabric
of a sonnet, however adapted to the Italian language, has never
succeeded in ours, which, having greater variety of termination,
requires the rhymes to be often changed.</p>
<p>Those little pieces may be despatched without much anxiety; a
greater work calls for greater care.&nbsp; I am now to examine
&ldquo;Paradise Lost;&rdquo; a poem which, considered with
respect to design, may claim the first place, and with respect to
performance, the second, among the productions of the human
mind.</p>
<p>By the general consent of critics the first praise of genius
is due to the writer of an epic poem, as it requires an
assemblage of all the powers which are singly sufficient for
other compositions.&nbsp; Poetry is the art of uniting pleasure
with truth, by calling imagination to the help of reason.&nbsp;
Epic poetry undertakes to teach the most important truths by the
most pleasing precepts, and therefore relates some great event in
the most affecting manner.&nbsp; History must supply the writer
with the rudiments of narration, which he must improve and exalt
by a nobler art, must animate by dramatic energy, and diversify
by retrospection and anticipation; morality must teach him the
exact bounds, and different shades, of vice and virtue; from
policy, and the practice of life, he has to learn the
discriminations of character, and the tendency of the passions,
either single or combined; and physiology must supply him with
illustrations and images.&nbsp; To put those materials to
poetical use, is required an imagination capable of painting
nature and realising fiction.&nbsp; Nor is he yet a poet till he
has attained the whole extension of his language, distinguished
all the delicacies of phrase, and all the colours of words, and
learned to adjust their different sounds to all the varieties of
metrical modulation.</p>
<p>Bossu is of opinion, that the poet&rsquo;s first work is to
find a <i>moral</i>, which his fable is afterwards to illustrate
and establish.&nbsp; This seems to have been the process only of
Milton; the moral of other poems is incidental and consequent; in
Milton&rsquo;s only it is essential and intrinsic.&nbsp; His
purpose was the most useful and the most arduous: &ldquo;to
vindicate the ways of God to man;&rdquo; to show the
reasonableness of religion, and the necessity of obedience to the
Divine Law.</p>
<p>To convey this moral there must be a <i>fable</i>, a narration
artfully constructed, so as to excite curiosity and surprise
expectation.&nbsp; In this part of his work Milton must be
confessed to have equalled every other poet.&nbsp; He has
involved in his account of the Fall of Man the events which
preceded and those that were to follow it: he has interwoven the
whole system of theology with such propriety, that every part
appears to be necessary; and scarcely any recital is wished
shorter for the sake of quickening the progress of the main
action.</p>
<p>The subject of an epic poem is naturally an event of great
importance.&nbsp; That of Milton is not the destruction of a
city, the conduct of a colony, or the foundation of an
empire.&nbsp; His subject is the fate of worlds, the revolutions
of heaven and of earth; rebellion against the Supreme King,
raised by the highest order of created beings; the overthrow of
their host, and the punishment of their crime; the creation of a
new race of reasonable creatures; their original happiness and
innocence, their forfeiture of immortality, and their restoration
to hope and peace.</p>
<p>Great events can be hastened or retarded only by persons of
elevated dignity.&nbsp; Before the greatness displayed in
Milton&rsquo;s poem, all other greatness shrinks away.&nbsp; The
weakest of his agents are the highest and noblest of human
beings, the original parents of mankind; with whose actions the
elements consented; on whose rectitude or deviation of will,
depended the state of terrestrial nature, and the condition of
all the future inhabitants of the globe.</p>
<p>Of the other agents in the poem, the chief are such as it is
irreverence to name on slight occasions.&nbsp; The rest were
lower powers&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of which the least could
wield<br />
Those elements, and arm him with the force<br />
Of all their regions;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>powers, which only the control of Omnipotence restrains from
laying creation waste, and filling the vast expanse of space with
ruin and confusion.&nbsp; To display the motives and actions of
beings thus superior, so far as human reason can examine them, or
human imagination represent them, is the task which this mighty
poet has undertaken and performed.</p>
<p>In the examination of epic poems much speculation is commonly
employed upon the <i>characters</i>.&nbsp; The characters in the
&ldquo;Paradise Lost,&rdquo; which admit of examination, are
those of angels and of man; of angels good and evil; of man in
his innocent and sinful state.</p>
<p>Among the angels, the virtue of Raphael is mild and placid, of
easy condescension and free communication; that of Michael is
regal and lofty, and, as may seem, attentive to the dignity of
his own nature.&nbsp; Abdiel and Gabriel appear occasionally, and
act as every incident requires; the solitary fidelity of Abdiel
is very amiably painted.</p>
<p>Of the evil angels the characters are more diversified.&nbsp;
To Satan, as Addison observes, such sentiments are given as suit
&ldquo;the most exalted and most depraved being.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Milton has been censured by Clarke, for the impiety which
sometimes breaks from Satan&rsquo;s mouth; for there are
thoughts, as he justly remarks, which no observation of character
can justify, because no good man would willingly permit them to
pass, however transiently, through his own mind.&nbsp; To make
Satan speak as a rebel, without any such expression as might
taint the reader&rsquo;s imagination, was indeed one of the great
difficulties in Milton&rsquo;s undertaking; and I cannot but
think that he has extricated himself with great happiness.&nbsp;
There is in Satan&rsquo;s speeches little that can give pain to a
pious ear.&nbsp; The language of rebellion cannot be the same
with that of obedience.&nbsp; The malignity of Satan foams in
haughtiness and obstinacy; but his expressions are commonly
general, and no otherwise offensive than as they are wicked.</p>
<p>The other chiefs of the celestial rebellion are very
judiciously discriminated in the first and second books; and the
ferocious character of Moloch appears, both in the battle and the
council, with exact consistency.</p>
<p>To Adam and to Eve are given, during their innocence, such
sentiments as innocence can generate and utter.&nbsp; Their love
is pure benevolence and mutual veneration; their repasts are
without luxury, and their diligence without toil.&nbsp; Their
addresses to their Maker have little more than the voice of
admiration and gratitude.&nbsp; Fruition left them nothing to
ask; and innocence left them nothing to fear.</p>
<p>But with guilt enter distrust and discord, mutual accusation,
and stubborn self-defence; they regard each other with alienated
minds, and dread their Creator as the avenger of their
transgression.&nbsp; At last they seek shelter in His mercy,
soften to repentance, and melt in supplication.&nbsp; Both before
and after the fall, the superiority of Adam is diligently
sustained.</p>
<p>Of the <i>probable</i> and the <i>marvellous</i>, two parts of
a vulgar epic poem which immerge the critic in deep
consideration, the &ldquo;Paradise Lost&rdquo; requires little to
be said.&nbsp; It contains the history of a miracle, of creation
and redemption; it displays the power and the mercy of the
Supreme Being; the probable therefore is marvellous, and the
marvellous is probable.&nbsp; The substance of the narrative is
truth; and, as truth allows no choice, it is, like necessity,
superior to rule.&nbsp; To the accidental or adventitious parts,
as to everything human, some slight exceptions may be made; but
the main fabric is immovably supported.</p>
<p>It is justly remarked by Addison, that this poem has, by the
nature of its subject, the advantage above all others, that it is
universally and perpetually interesting.&nbsp; All mankind will,
through all ages, bear the same relation to Adam and to Eve, and
must partake of that good and evil which extend to
themselves.</p>
<p>Of the <i>machinery</i>, so called from
&Theta;&epsilon;&ograve;&sigmaf; &#8048;&pi;&ograve;
&mu;&eta;&chi;&alpha;&nu;&eta;&sigmaf;, by which is meant the
occasional interposition of supernatural power, another fertile
topic of critical remarks, here is no room to speak, because
everything is done under the immediate and visible direction of
Heaven; but the rule is so far observed, that no part of the
action could have been accomplished by any other means.</p>
<p>Of <i>episodes</i>, I think there are only two&mdash;contained
in Raphael&rsquo;s relation of the war in Heaven, and
Michael&rsquo;s prophetic account of the changes to happen in
this world.&nbsp; Both are closely connected with the great
action; one was necessary to Adam as a warning, the other as a
consolation.</p>
<p>To the completeness or <i>integrity</i> of the design nothing
can be objected; it has distinctly and clearly what Aristotle
requires&mdash;a beginning, a middle, and an end.&nbsp; There is
perhaps no poem, of the same length, from which so little can be
taken without apparent mutilation.&nbsp; Here are no funeral
games, nor is there any long description of a shield.&nbsp; The
short digressions at the beginning of the third, seventh, and
ninth books, might doubtless be spared, but superfluities so
beautiful who would take away? or who does not wish that the
author of the &ldquo;Iliad&rdquo; had gratified succeeding ages
with a little knowledge of himself?&nbsp; Perhaps no passages are
more attentively read than those extrinsic paragraphs; and, since
the end of poetry is pleasure, that cannot be unpoetical with
which all are pleased.</p>
<p>The questions, whether the action of the poem be strictly
<i>one</i>, whether the poem can be properly termed
<i>heroic</i>, and who is the hero, are raised by such readers as
draw their principles of judgment rather from books than from
reason.&nbsp; Milton, though he entitled &ldquo;Paradise
Lost&rdquo; only a &ldquo;poem,&rdquo; yet calls it himself
&ldquo;heroic song.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dryden petulantly and indecently
denies the heroism of Adam, because he was overcome; but there is
no reason why the hero should not be unfortunate, except
established practice, since success and virtue do not go
necessarily together.&nbsp; Cato is the hero of Lucan; but
Lucan&rsquo;s authority will not be suffered by Quintilian to
decide.&nbsp; However, if success be necessary, Adam&rsquo;s
deceiver was at last crushed; Adam was restored to his
Maker&rsquo;s favour, and therefore may securely resume his human
rank.</p>
<p>After the scheme and fabric of the poem, must be considered
its component parts, the sentiments and the diction.</p>
<p>The <i>sentiments</i>, as expressive of manners, or
appropriated to characters, are, for the greater part,
unexceptionably just.</p>
<p>Splendid passages, containing lessons of morality, or precepts
of prudence, occur seldom.&nbsp; Such is the original formation
of this poem, that, as it admits no human manners till the Fall,
it can give little assistance to human conduct.&nbsp; Its end is
to raise the thoughts above sublunary cares or pleasures.&nbsp;
Yet the praise of that fortitude, with which Abdiel maintained
his singularity of virtue against the scorn of multitudes, may be
accommodated to all times; and Raphael&rsquo;s reproof of
Adam&rsquo;s curiosity after the planetary motions, with the
answer returned by Adam, may be confidently opposed to any rule
of life which any poet has delivered.</p>
<p>The thoughts which are occasionally called forth in the
progress are such as could only be produced by an imagination in
the highest degree fervid and active, to which materials were
supplied by incessant study and unlimited curiosity.&nbsp; The
heat of Milton&rsquo;s mind may be said to sublimate his
learning, to throw off into his work the spirit of science,
unmingled with its grosser parts.</p>
<p>He had considered creation in its whole extent, and his
descriptions are therefore learned.&nbsp; He had accustomed his
imagination to unrestrained indulgence, and his conceptions
therefore were extensive.&nbsp; The characteristic quality of his
poem is sublimity.&nbsp; He sometimes descends to the elegant,
but his element is the great.&nbsp; He can occasionally invest
himself with grace; but his natural port is gigantic
loftiness.&nbsp; He can please when pleasure is required; but it
is his peculiar power to astonish.</p>
<p>He seems to have been well acquainted with his own genius, and
to know what it was that Nature had bestowed upon him more
bountifully than upon others&mdash;the power of displaying the
vast, illuminating the splendid, enforcing the awful, darkening
the gloomy, and aggravating the dreadful; he therefore chose a
subject on which too much could not be said, on which he might
tire his fancy without the censure of extravagance.</p>
<p>The appearances of nature, and the occurrences of life, did
not satiate his appetite of greatness.&nbsp; To paint things as
they are requires a minute attention, and employs the memory
rather than the fancy.&nbsp; Milton&rsquo;s delight was to sport
in the wide regions of possibility; reality was a scene too
narrow for his mind.&nbsp; He sent his faculties out upon
discovery, into worlds where only imagination can travel, and
delighted to form new modes of existence, and furnish sentiment
and action to superior beings; to trace the counsels of hell, or
accompany the choirs of heaven.</p>
<p>But he could not be always in other worlds; he must sometimes
revisit earth, and tell of things visible and known.&nbsp; When
he cannot raise wonder by the sublimity of his mind, he gives
delight by its fertility.</p>
<p>Whatever be his subject, he never fails to fill the
imagination.&nbsp; But his images and descriptions of the scenes
or operations of nature do not seem to be always copied from
original form, nor to have the freshness, raciness, and energy of
immediate observation.&nbsp; He saw nature, as Dryden expresses
it, &ldquo;through the spectacles of books;&rdquo; and on most
occasions calls learning to his assistance.&nbsp; The garden of
Eden brings to his mind the vale of Enna, where Proserpine was
gathering flowers.&nbsp; Satan makes his way through fighting
elements, like Argo between the Cyanean rocks, or Ulysses between
the two Sicilian whirlpools, when he shunned Charybdis on the
larboard.&nbsp; The mythological allusions have been justly
censured, as not being always used with notice of their vanity;
but they contribute variety to the narration, and produce an
alternate exercise of the memory and the fancy.</p>
<p>His similes are less numerous, and more various, than those of
his predecessors.&nbsp; But he does not confine himself within
the limits of rigorous comparison: his great excellence is
amplitude; and he expands the adventitious image beyond the
dimensions which the occasion required.&nbsp; Thus, comparing the
shield of Satan to the orb of the moon, he crowds the imagination
with the discovery of the telescope, and all the wonders which
the telescope discovers.</p>
<p>Of his moral sentiments it is hardly praise to affirm that
they excel those of all other poets; for this superiority he was
indebted to his acquaintance with the sacred writings.&nbsp; The
ancient epic poets, wanting the light of Revelation, were very
unskilful teachers of virtue; their principal characters may be
great, but they are not amiable.&nbsp; The reader may rise from
their works with a greater degree of active or passive fortitude,
and sometimes of prudence; but he will be able to carry away few
precepts of justice, and none of mercy.</p>
<p>From the Italian writers it appears that the advantages of
even Christian knowledge may be possessed in vain.&nbsp;
Ariosto&rsquo;s pravity is generally known; and, though the
&ldquo;Deliverance of Jerusalem&rdquo; may be considered as a
sacred subject, the poet has been very sparing of moral
instruction.</p>
<p>In Milton every line breathes sanctity of thought, and purity
of manners, except when the train of the narration requires the
introduction of the rebellious spirits; and even they are
compelled to acknowledge their subjection to God, in such a
manner as excites reverence and confirms piety.</p>
<p>Of human beings there are but two; but those two are the
parents of mankind, venerable before their fall for dignity and
innocence, and amiable after it for repentance and
submission.&nbsp; In the first state their affection is tender
without weakness, and their piety sublime without
presumption.&nbsp; When they have sinned, they show how discord
begins in mutual frailty, and how it ought to cease in mutual
forbearance; how confidence of the Divine favour is forfeited by
sin, and how hope of pardon may be obtained by penitence and
prayer.&nbsp; A state of innocence we can only conceive, if
indeed, in our present misery, it be possible to conceive it; but
the sentiments and worship proper to a fallen and offending
being, we have all to learn, as we have all to practise.</p>
<p>The poet, whatever be done, is always great.&nbsp; Our
progenitors in their first state conversed with angels; even when
folly and sin had degraded them, they had not in their
humiliation &ldquo;the port of mean suitors;&rdquo; and they rise
again to reverential regard, when we find that their prayers were
heard.</p>
<p>As human passions did not enter the world before the Fall,
there is in the &ldquo;Paradise Lost&rdquo; little opportunity
for the pathetic; but what little there is has not been
lost.&nbsp; That passion, which is peculiar to rational nature,
the anguish arising from the consciousness of transgression, and
the horrors attending the sense of the Divine displeasure, are
very justly described and forcibly impressed.&nbsp; But the
passions are moved only on one occasion; sublimity is the general
and prevailing quality in this poem; sublimity variously
modified&mdash;sometimes descriptive, sometimes
argumentative.</p>
<p>The defects and faults of &ldquo;Paradise
Lost&rdquo;&mdash;for faults and defects every work of man must
have&mdash;it is the business of impartial criticism to
discover.&nbsp; As, in displaying the excellence of Milton, I
have not made long quotations, because of selecting beauties
there had been no end, I shall in the same general manner mention
that which seems to deserve censure; for what Englishman can take
delight in transcribing passages, which, if they lessen the
reputation of Milton, diminish in some degree the honour of our
country?</p>
<p>The generality of my scheme does not admit the frequent notice
of verbal inaccuracies; which Bentley, perhaps better skilled in
grammar and poetry, has often found, though he sometimes made
them, and which he imputed to the obtrusions of a reviser, whom
the author&rsquo;s blindness obliged him to employ; a supposition
rash and groundless, if he thought it true; and vile and
pernicious, if, as is said, he in private allowed it to be
false.</p>
<p>The plan of &ldquo;Paradise Lost&rdquo; has this
inconvenience, that it comprises neither human actions nor human
manners.&nbsp; The man and woman who act and suffer are in a
state which no other man or woman can ever know.&nbsp; The reader
finds no transaction in which he can be engaged&mdash;beholds no
condition in which he can by any effort of imagination place
himself; he has, therefore, little natural curiosity or
sympathy.</p>
<p>We all, indeed, feel the effects of Adam&rsquo;s disobedience;
we all sin like Adam, and like him must all bewail our offences;
we have restless and insidious enemies in the fallen angels, and
in the blessed spirits we have guardians and friends; in the
redemption of mankind we hope to be included; in the description
of heaven and hell we are surely interested, as we are all to
reside hereafter either in the regions of horror or bliss.</p>
<p>But these truths are too important to be new; they have been
taught to our infancy; they have mingled with our solitary
thoughts and familiar conversations, and are habitually
interwoven with the whole texture of life.&nbsp; Being therefore
not new, they raise no unaccustomed emotion in the mind; what we
knew before, we cannot learn; what is not unexpected, cannot
surprise.</p>
<p>Of the ideas suggested by these awful scenes, from some we
recede with reverence, except when stated hours require their
association; and from others we shrink with horror, or admit them
only as salutary inflictions, as counterpoises to our interests
and passions.&nbsp; Such images rather obstruct the career of
fancy than incite it.</p>
<p>Pleasure and terror are indeed the genuine sources of poetry;
but poetical pleasure must be such as human imagination can at
least conceive, and poetical terrors such as human strength and
fortitude may combat.&nbsp; The good and evil of eternity are too
ponderous for the wings of wit; the mind sinks under them in
passive helplessness, content with calm belief and humble
adoration.</p>
<p>Known truths, however, may take a different appearance, and be
conveyed to the mind by a new train of intermediate images.&nbsp;
This Milton has undertaken and performed with pregnancy and
vigour of mind peculiar to himself.&nbsp; Whoever considers the
few radical positions which the Scriptures afforded him, will
wonder by what energetic operation he expanded them to such
extent, and ramified them to so much variety, restrained as he
was by religious reverence from licentiousness of fiction.</p>
<p>Here is a full display of the united force of study and
genius&mdash;of a great accumulation of materials, with judgment
to digest and fancy to combine them: Milton was able to select
from nature or from story, from an ancient fable or from modern
science, whatever could illustrate or adorn his thoughts.&nbsp;
An accumulation of knowledge impregnated his mind, fermented by
study and exalted by imagination.</p>
<p>It has been therefore said, without an indecent hyperbole, by
one of his encomiasts, that in reading &ldquo;Paradise
Lost&rdquo; we read a book of universal knowledge.</p>
<p>But original deficiency cannot be supplied.&nbsp; The want of
human interest is always felt.&nbsp; &ldquo;Paradise Lost&rdquo;
is one of the books which the reader admires and lays down, and
forgets to take up again.&nbsp; None ever wished it longer than
it is.&nbsp; Its perusal is a duty rather than a pleasure.&nbsp;
We read Milton for instruction, retire harassed and overburdened,
and look elsewhere for recreation; we desert our master, and seek
for companions.</p>
<p>Another inconvenience of Milton&rsquo;s design is, that it
requires the description of what cannot be described, the agency
of spirits.&nbsp; He saw that immateriality supplied no images,
and that he could not show angels acting but by instruments of
action; he therefore invested them with form and matter.&nbsp;
This, being necessary, was therefore defensible; and he should
have secured the consistency of his system, by keeping
immateriality out of sight, and enticing his reader to drop it
from his thoughts.&nbsp; But he has unhappily perplexed his
poetry with his philosophy.&nbsp; His infernal and celestial
powers are sometimes pure spirit, and sometimes animated
body.&nbsp; When Satan walks with his lance upon the
&ldquo;burning marl,&rdquo; he has a body; when, in his passage
between hell and the new world, he is in danger of sinking in the
vacuity, and is supported by a gust of rising vapours, he has a
body; when he animates the toad, he seems to be more spirit, that
can penetrate matter at pleasure; when he &ldquo;starts up in his
own shape,&rdquo; he has at least a determined form; and when he
is brought before Gabriel, he has &ldquo;a spear and a
shield,&rdquo; which he had the power of hiding in the toad,
though the arms of the contending angels are evidently
material.</p>
<p>The vulgar inhabitants of Pand&aelig;monium, being
&ldquo;incorporeal spirits,&rdquo; are &ldquo;at large, though
without number,&rdquo; in a limited space: yet in the battle,
when they were overwhelmed by mountains, their armour hurt them,
&ldquo;crushed in upon their substance, now grown gross by
sinning.&rdquo;&nbsp; This likewise happened to the uncorrupted
angels, who were overthrown the &ldquo;sooner for their arms, for
unarmed they might easily as spirits have evaded by contraction
or remove.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even as spirits they are hardly
spiritual: for &ldquo;contraction&rdquo; and &ldquo;remove&rdquo;
are images of matter; but if they could have escaped without
their armour, they might have escaped from it, and left only the
empty cover to be battered.&nbsp; Uriel, when he rides on a
sunbeam, is material; Satan is material when he is afraid of the
prowess of Adam.</p>
<p>The confusion of spirit and matter, which pervades the whole
narration of the war of heaven, fills it with incongruity; and
the book in which it is related is, I believe, the favourite of
children, and gradually neglected as knowledge is increased.</p>
<p>After the operation of immaterial agents, which cannot be
explained, may be considered that of allegorical persons which
have no real existence.&nbsp; To exalt causes into agents, to
invest abstract ideas with form, and animate them with activity,
has always been the right of poetry.&nbsp; But such airy beings
are, for the most part, suffered only to do their natural office,
and retire.&nbsp; Thus Fame tells a tale, and Victory hovers over
a general, or perches on a standard; but Fame and Victory can do
no more.&nbsp; To give them any real employment, or ascribe to
them any material agency, is to make them allegorical no longer,
but to shock the mind by ascribing effects to nonentity.&nbsp; In
the &ldquo;Prometheus&rdquo; of &AElig;schylus, we see Violence
and Strength, and in the &ldquo;Alcestis&rdquo; of Euripides we
see Death, brought upon the stage, all as active persons of the
drama; but no precedents can justify absurdity.</p>
<p>Milton&rsquo;s allegory of Sin and Death is undoubtedly
faulty.&nbsp; Sin is indeed the mother of Death, and may be
allowed to be the portress of hell; but when they stop the
journey of Satan, a journey described as real, and when Death
offers him battle, the allegory is broken.&nbsp; That Sin and
Death should have shown the way to hell, might have been allowed;
but they cannot facilitate the passage by building a bridge,
because the difficulty of Satan&rsquo;s passage is described as
real and sensible, and the bridge ought to be only
figurative.&nbsp; The hell assigned to the rebellious spirits is
described as not less local than the residence of man.&nbsp; It
is placed in some distant part of space, separated from the
regions of harmony and order by a chaotic waste and an unoccupied
vacuity; but Sin and Death worked up a &ldquo;mole of aggravated
soil&rdquo; cemented with <i>asphaltus</i>, a work too bulky for
ideal architects.</p>
<p>This unskilful allegory appears to me one of the greatest
faults of the poem; and to this there was no temptation but the
author&rsquo;s opinion of its beauty.</p>
<p>To the conduct of the narrative some objections may be
made.&nbsp; Satan is with great expectation brought before
Gabriel in Paradise, and is suffered to go away unmolested.&nbsp;
The creation of man is represented as the consequence of the
vacuity left in heaven by the expulsion of the rebels; yet Satan
mentions it as a report &ldquo;rife in Heaven&rdquo; before his
departure.</p>
<p>To find sentiments for the state of innocence was very
difficult; and something of anticipation perhaps is now and then
discovered.&nbsp; Adam&rsquo;s discourse of dreams seems not to
be the speculation of a new-created being.&nbsp; I know not
whether his answer to the angel&rsquo;s reproof for curiosity
does not want something of propriety; it is the speech of a man
acquainted with many other men.&nbsp; Some philosophical notions,
especially when the philosophy is false, might have been better
omitted.&nbsp; The angel, in a comparison, speaks of
&ldquo;timorous deer,&rdquo; before deer were yet timorous, and
before Adam could understand the comparison.</p>
<p>Dryden remarks, that Milton has some flats among his
elevations.&nbsp; This is only to say, that all the parts are not
equal.&nbsp; In every work, one part must be for the sake of
others; a palace must have passages; a poem must have
transitions.&nbsp; It is no more to be required that wit should
always be blazing, than that the sun should always stand at
noon.&nbsp; In a great work there is a vicissitude of luminous
and opaque parts, as there is in the world a succession of day
and night.&nbsp; Milton, when he has expatiated in the sky, may
be allowed sometimes to revisit earth; for what other author ever
soared so high, or sustained his flight so long?</p>
<p>Milton, being well versed in the Italian poets, appears to
have borrowed often from them; and, as every man catches
something from his companions, his desire of imitating
Ariosto&rsquo;s levity has disgraced his work with the Paradise
of Fools; a fiction not in itself ill-imagined, but too ludicrous
for its place.</p>
<p>His play on words, in which he delights too often; his
equivocations, which Bentley endeavours to defend by the example
of the ancients; his unnecessary and ungraceful use of terms of
art; it is not necessary to mention, because they are easily
remarked, and generally censured; and at last bear so little
proportion to the whole, that they scarcely deserve the attention
of a critic.</p>
<p>Such are the faults of that wonderful performance
&ldquo;Paradise Lost;&rdquo; which he who can put in balance with
its beauties must be considered not as nice but as dull, as less
to be censured for want of candour than pitied for want of
sensibility.</p>
<p>Of &ldquo;Paradise Regained,&rdquo; the general judgment seems
now to be right, that it is in many parts elegant, and everywhere
instructive.&nbsp; It was not to be supposed that the writer of
&ldquo;Paradise Lost&rdquo; could ever write without great
effusions of fancy, and exalted precepts of wisdom.&nbsp; The
basis of &ldquo;Paradise Regained&rdquo; is narrow; a dialogue
without action can never please like a union of the narrative and
dramatic powers.&nbsp; Had this poem been written not by Milton,
but by some imitator, it would have claimed and received
universal praise.</p>
<p>If &ldquo;Paradise Regained&rdquo; has been too much
depreciated, &ldquo;Samson Agonistes&rdquo; has, in requital,
been too much admired.&nbsp; It could only be by long prejudice,
and the bigotry of learning, that Milton could prefer the ancient
tragedies, with their encumbrance of a chorus, to the exhibitions
of the French and English stages; and it is only by a blind
confidence in the reputation of Milton that a drama can be
praised in which the intermediate parts have neither cause nor
consequence, neither hasten nor retard the catastrophe.</p>
<p>In this tragedy are, however, many particular beauties, many
just sentiments and striking lines; but it wants that power of
attracting the attention which a well connected plan
produces.</p>
<p>Milton would not have excelled in dramatic writing; he knew
human nature only in the gross, and had never studied the shades
of character, nor the combinations of concurring, or the
perplexity of contending passions.&nbsp; He had read much, and
knew what books could teach; but had mingled little in the world,
and was deficient in the knowledge which experience must
confer.</p>
<p>Through all his greater works there prevails a uniform
peculiarity of <i>diction</i>, a mode and cast of expression
which bears little resemblance to that of any former writer; and
which is so far removed from common use, that an unlearned
reader, when he first opens his book, finds himself surprised by
a new language.</p>
<p>This novelty has been, by those who can find nothing wrong in
Milton, imputed to his laborious endeavours after words suitable
to the grandeur of his ideas.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our language,&rdquo;
says Addison, &ldquo;sank under him.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the truth
is, that, both in prose and verse, he had formed his style by a
perverse and pedantic principle.&nbsp; He was desirous to use
English words with a foreign idiom.&nbsp; This, in all his prose,
is discovered and condemned; for there judgment operates freely,
neither softened by the beauty, nor awed by the dignity of his
thoughts; but such is the power of his poetry, that his call is
obeyed without resistance, the reader feels himself in captivity
to a higher and a nobler mind, and criticism sinks in
admiration.</p>
<p>Milton&rsquo;s style was not modified by his subject; what is
shown with greater extent in &ldquo;Paradise Lost&rdquo; may be
found in &ldquo;Comus.&rdquo;&nbsp; One source of his peculiarity
was his familiarity with the Tuscan poets; the disposition of his
words is, I think, frequently Italian; perhaps sometimes combined
with other tongues.&nbsp; Of him, at last, may be said what
Jonson says of Spenser, that &ldquo;he wrote no language,&rdquo;
but has formed what Butler calls a &ldquo;Babylonish
dialect,&rdquo; in itself harsh and barbarous, but made by
exalted genius and extensive learning the vehicle of so much
instruction and so much pleasure, that, like other lovers, we
find grace in its deformity.</p>
<p>Whatever be the faults of his diction, he cannot want the
praise of copiousness and variety.&nbsp; He was master of his
language in its full extent; and has selected the melodious words
with such diligence, that from his book alone the Art of English
Poetry might be learned.</p>
<p>After his diction something must be said of his
<i>versification</i>.&nbsp; The <i>measure</i>, he says,
&ldquo;is the English heroic verse without rhyme.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of
this mode he had many examples among the Italians, and some in
his own country.&nbsp; The Earl of Surrey is said to have
translated one of Virgil&rsquo;s books without rhyme; and, beside
our tragedies, a few short poems had appeared in blank verse,
particularly one tending to reconcile the nation to
Raleigh&rsquo;s wild attempt upon Guiana, and probably written by
Raleigh himself.&nbsp; These petty performances cannot be
supposed to have much influenced Milton, who more probably took
his hint from Trissino&rsquo;s &ldquo;Italia Liberata;&rdquo;
and, finding blank verse easier than rhyme, was desirous of
persuading himself that it is better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhyme,&rdquo; he says, and says truly, &ldquo;is no
necessary adjunct of true poetry.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, perhaps, of
poetry, as a mental operation, metre or music is no necessary
adjunct: it is, however, by the music of metre that poetry has
been discriminated in all languages; and, in languages
melodiously constructed with a due proportion of long and short
syllables, metre is sufficient.&nbsp; But one language cannot
communicate its rules to another; where metre is scanty and
imperfect, some help is necessary.&nbsp; The music of the English
heroic lines strikes the ear so faintly, that it is easily lost,
unless all the syllables of every line co-operate together; this
co-operation can only be obtained by the preservation of every
verse unmingled with another as a distinct system of sounds; and
this distinctness is obtained and preserved by the artifice of
rhyme.&nbsp; The variety of pauses, so much boasted by the lovers
of blank verse, changes the measures of an English poet to the
periods of a declaimer; and there are only a few skilful and
happy readers of Milton, who enable their audience to perceive
where the lines end or begin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Blank verse,&rdquo;
said an ingenious critic, &ldquo;seems to be verse only to the
eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poetry may subsist without rhyme, but English poetry will not
often please; nor can rhyme ever be safely spared but where the
subject is able to support itself.&nbsp; Blank verse makes some
approach to that which is called the &ldquo;lapidary
style;&rdquo; has neither the easiness of prose, nor the melody
of numbers, and therefore tires by long continuance.&nbsp; Of the
Italian writers without rhyme, whom Milton alleges as precedents,
not one is popular; what reason could urge in its defence has
been confuted by the ear.</p>
<p>But, whatever be the advantages of rhyme, I cannot prevail on
myself to wish that Milton had been a rhymer; for I cannot wish
his work to be other than it is; yet like other heroes, he is to
be admired rather than imitated.&nbsp; He that thinks himself
capable of astonishing may write blank verse; but those that hope
only to please must condescend to rhyme.</p>
<p>The highest praise of genius is original invention.&nbsp;
Milton cannot be said to have contrived the structure of an epic
poem, and therefore owes reverence to that vigour and amplitude
of mind to which all generations must be indebted for the art of
poetical narration, for the texture of the fable, the variation
of incidents, the interposition of dialogue, and all the
stratagems that surprise and enchain attention.&nbsp; But, of all
the borrowers from Homer, Milton is perhaps the least
indebted.&nbsp; He was naturally a thinker for himself, confident
of his own abilities, and disdainful of help or hindrance: he did
not refuse admission to the thoughts or images of his
predecessors, but he did not seek them.&nbsp; From his
contemporaries he neither courted nor received support; there is
in his writings nothing by which the pride of other authors might
be gratified, or favour gained; no exchange of praise, nor
solicitation of support.&nbsp; His great works were performed
under discountenance and in blindness; but difficulties vanished
at his touch; he was born for whatever is arduous; and his work
is not the greatest of heroic poems, only because it is not the
first.</p>
<h2>COWLEY.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Life of Cowley, notwithstanding
the penury of English biography, has been written by Dr. Sprat,
an author whose pregnancy of imagination and elegance of language
have deservedly set him high in the ranks of literature; but his
zeal of friendship, or ambition of eloquence, has produced a
funeral oration rather than a history: he has given the
character, not the life, of Cowley; for he writes with so little
detail, that scarcely anything is distinctly known, but all is
shown confused and enlarged through the mist of panegyric.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Abraham Cowley</span> was born in the year
one thousand sir hundred and eighteen.&nbsp; His father was a
grocer, whose condition Dr. Sprat conceals under the general
appellation of a citizen; and, what would probably not have been
less carefully suppressed, the omission of his name in the
register of St. Dunstan&rsquo;s parish gives reason to suspect
that his father was a sectary.&nbsp; Whoever he was, he died
before the birth of his son, and consequently left him to the
care of his mother: whom Wood represents as struggling earnestly
to procure him a literary education, and who, as she lived to the
age of eighty, had her solicitude rewarded by seeing her son
eminent, and, I hope, by seeing him fortunate, and partaking his
prosperity.&nbsp; We know at least, from Sprat&rsquo;s account,
that he always acknowledged her care, and justly paid the dues of
filial gratitude.</p>
<p>In the window of his mother&rsquo;s apartment lay
Spenser&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fairy Queen,&rdquo; in which he very early
took delight to read, till by feeling the charms of verse, he
became, as he relates, irrecoverably a poet.&nbsp; Such are the
accidents which, sometimes remembered, and perhaps sometimes
forgotten, produce that particular designation of mind, and
propensity for some certain science or employment, which is
commonly called Genius.&nbsp; The true Genius is a mind of large
general powers, accidentally determined to some particular
direction.&nbsp; Sir Joshua Reynolds, the great painter of the
present age, had the first fondness for his art excited by the
perusal of Richardson&rsquo;s treatise.</p>
<p>By his mother&rsquo;s solicitation he was admitted into
Westminster school, where he was soon distinguished.&nbsp; He was
wont, says Sprat, to relate, &ldquo;that he had this defect in
his memory at that time, that his teachers never could bring it
to retain the ordinary rules of grammar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is an instance of the natural desire of man to propagate
a wonder.&nbsp; It is surely very difficult to tell anything as
it was heard, when Sprat could not refrain from amplifying a
commodious incident, though the book to which he prefixed his
narrative contained its confutation.&nbsp; A memory admitting
some things, and rejecting others, an intellectual digestion that
concocted the pulp of learning, but refused the husks, had the
appearance of an instinctive elegance, of a particular provision
made by nature for literary politeness.&nbsp; But in the
author&rsquo;s own honest relation, the marvel vanishes: he was,
he says, such &ldquo;an enemy to all constraint, that his master
never could prevail on him to learn the rules without
book.&rdquo;&nbsp; He does not tell that he could not learn the
rules; but that, being able to perform his exercises without
them, and being an &ldquo;enemy to constraint,&rdquo; he spared
himself the labour.</p>
<p>Among the English poets, Cowley, Milton, and Pope might be
said &ldquo;to lisp in numbers;&rdquo; and have given such early
proofs, not only of powers of language, but of comprehension of
things, as to more tardy minds seems scarcely credible.&nbsp; But
of the learned puerilities of Cowley there is no doubt, since a
volume of his poems was not only written, but printed in his
thirteenth year; containing, with other poetical compositions,
&ldquo;The tragical History of Pyramus and Thisbe,&rdquo; written
when he was ten years old; and &ldquo;Constantia and
Philetus,&rdquo; written two years after.</p>
<p>While he was yet at school he produced a comedy called
&ldquo;Love&rsquo;s Riddle,&rdquo; though it was not published
till he had been some time at Cambridge.&nbsp; This comedy is of
the pastoral kind, which requires no acquaintance with the living
world, and therefore the time at which it was composed adds
little to the wonders of Cowley&rsquo;s minority.</p>
<p>In 1636 he was removed to Cambridge, where he continued his
studies with great intenseness; for he is said to have written,
while he was yet a young student, the greater part of his
&ldquo;Davideis;&rdquo; a work of which the materials could not
have been collected without the study of many years, but by a
mind of the greatest vigour and activity.</p>
<p>Two years after his settlement at Cambridge, he published
&ldquo;Love&rsquo;s Riddle,&rdquo; with a poetical dedication to
Sir Kenelm Digby, of whose acquaintance all his contemporaries
seem to have been ambitious; and &ldquo;Naufragium
Joculare,&rdquo; a comedy written in Latin, but without due
attention to the ancient models; for it is not loose verse, but
mere prose.&nbsp; It was printed, with a dedication in verse to
Dr. Comber, master of the college; but having neither the
facility of a popular, nor the accuracy of a learned work, it
seems to be now universally neglected.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the civil war, as the prince passed
through Cambridge in his way to York, he was entertained with the
representation of &ldquo;The Guardian,&rdquo; a comedy which
Cowley says was neither written nor acted, but rough-drawn by
him, and repeated by the scholars.&nbsp; That this comedy was
printed during his absence from his country he appears to have
considered as injurious to his reputation; though, during the
suppression of the theatres, it was sometimes privately acted
with sufficient approbation.</p>
<p>In 1643, being now master of arts, he was, by the prevalence
of the Parliament, ejected from Cambridge, and sheltered himself
at St. John&rsquo;s College in Oxford; where, as is said by Wood,
he published a satire, called &ldquo;The Puritan and
Papist,&rdquo; which was only inserted in the last collection of
his works; and so distinguished himself by the warmth of his
loyalty, and the elegance of his conversation, that he gained the
kindness and confidence of those who attended the king, and
amongst others of Lord Falkland, whose notice cast a lustre on
all to whom it was extended.</p>
<p>About the time when Oxford was surrendered to the Parliament,
he followed the Queen to Paris, where he became secretary to the
Lord Jermyn, afterwards Earl of St. Albans, and was employed in
such correspondence as the royal cause required, and particularly
in ciphering and deciphering the letters that passed between the
king and queen; an employment of the highest confidence and
honour.&nbsp; So wide was his province of intelligence, that for
several years it filled all his days and two or three nights in
the week.</p>
<p>In the year 1647, his &ldquo;Mistress&rdquo; was published;
for he imagined, as he declared in his preface to a subsequent
edition, that &ldquo;poets are scarcely thought freemen of their
company, without paying some duties, or obliging themselves to be
true to love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This obligation to amorous ditties owes, I believe, its
original to the fame of Petrarch, who, in an age rude and
uncultivated, by his tuneful homage to his Laura refined the
manners of the lettered world, and filled Europe with love and
poetry.&nbsp; But the basis of all excellence is truth: he that
professes love ought to feel its power.&nbsp; Petrarch was a real
lover, and Laura doubtless deserved his tenderness.&nbsp; Of
Cowley, we are told by Barnes, who had means enough of
information, that, whatever he may talk of his own
inflammability, and the variety of characters by which his heart
was divided, he in reality was in love but once, and then never
had resolution to tell his passion.</p>
<p>This consideration cannot but abate in some measure the
reader&rsquo;s esteem for the works and the author.&nbsp; To love
excellence is natural; it is natural likewise for the lover to
solicit reciprocal regard by an elaborate display of his own
qualifications.&nbsp; The desire of pleasing has in different men
produced actions of heroism, and effusions of wit; but it seems
as reasonable to appear the champion as the poet of an airy
&ldquo;nothing,&rdquo; and to quarrel as to write for what Cowley
might have learned from his master Pindar to call &ldquo;the
dream of a shadow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is surely not difficult, in the solitude of a college, or
in the bustle of the world, to find useful studies and serious
employment.&nbsp; No man needs to be so burdened with life as to
squander it in voluntary dreams of fictitious occurrences.&nbsp;
The man that sits down to suppose himself charged with treason or
peculation, and heats his mind to an elaborate purgation of his
character from crimes which he was never within the possibility
of committing, differs only by the infrequency of his folly from
him who praises beauty which he never saw; complains of jealousy
which he never felt; supposes himself sometimes invited, and
sometimes forsaken; fatigues his fancy, and ransacks his memory
for images which may exhibit the gaiety of hope or the gloominess
of despair; and dresses his imaginary Chloris or Phyllis
sometimes in flowers fading as her beauty, and sometimes in gems
lasting as her virtues.</p>
<p>At Paris, as secretary to Lord Jermyn, he was engaged in
transacting things of real importance with real men and real
women, and at that time did not much employ his thoughts upon
phantoms of gallantry.&nbsp; Some of his letters to Mr. Bennet,
afterwards Earl of Arlington, from April to December, in 1650,
are preserved in &ldquo;Miscellanea Aulica,&rdquo; a collection
of papers published by Brown.&nbsp; These letters, being written
like those of other men whose minds are more on things than
words, contribute no otherwise to his reputation, than as they
show him to have been above the affectation of unseasonable
elegance, and to have known that the business of a statesman can
be little forwarded by flowers of rhetoric.</p>
<p>One passage, however, seems not unworthy of some notice.&nbsp;
Speaking of the Scotch treaty then in agitation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Scotch treaty,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;is the only
thing now in which we are vitally concerned; I am one of the last
hopers, and yet cannot now abstain from believing that an
agreement will be made; all people upon the place incline to that
opinion.&nbsp; The Scotch will moderate something of the rigour
of their demands; the mutual necessity of an accord is visible;
the king is persuaded of it.&nbsp; And to tell you the truth
(which I take to be an argument above all the rest), Virgil has
told me something to that purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This expression, from a secretary of the present time, would
be considered as merely ludicrous, or at most as an ostentatious
display of scholarship; but the manners of that time were so
tinged with superstition, that I cannot but suspect Cowley of
having consulted on this great occasion the Virgilian lots, and
to have given some credit to the answer of his oracle.</p>
<p>Some years afterwards, &ldquo;business,&rdquo; says Sprat,
&ldquo;passed of course into other hands;&rdquo; and Cowley,
being no longer useful at Paris, was in 1656 sent back into
England, that, &ldquo;under pretence of privacy and retirement,
he might take occasion of giving notice of the posture of things
in this nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon after his return to London, he was seized by some
messengers of the usurping powers, who were sent out in quest of
another man; and being examined, was put into confinement, from
which he was not dismissed without the security of a thousand
pounds given by Dr. Scarborough.</p>
<p>This year he published his poems, with a preface, in which he
seems to have inserted something suppressed in subsequent
editions, which was interpreted to denote some relaxation of his
loyalty.&nbsp; In this preface he declares, that &ldquo;his
desire had been for some days past, and did still very vehemently
continue, to retire himself to some of the American plantations,
and to forsake this world for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the obloquy which the appearance of submission to the
usurpers brought upon him, his biographer has been very diligent
to clear him, and indeed it does not seem to have lessened his
reputation.&nbsp; His wish for retirement we can easily believe
to be undissembled; a man harassed in one kingdom, and persecuted
in another, who, after a course of business that employed all his
days and half his nights, in ciphering and deciphering, comes to
his own country and steps into a prison, will be willing enough
to retire to some place of quiet and of safety.&nbsp; Yet let
neither our reverence for a genius, nor our pity for a sufferer,
dispose us to forget, that, if his activity was virtue, his
retreat was cowardice.</p>
<p>He then took upon him the character of physician, still,
according to Sprat, with intention &ldquo;to dissemble the main
design of his coming over;&rdquo; and, as Mr. Wood relates,
&ldquo;complying with the men then in power (which was much taken
notice of by the royal party), he obtained an order to be created
doctor of physic; which being done to his mind (whereby he gained
the ill-will of some of his friends), he went into France again,
having made a copy of verses on Oliver&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is no favourable representation; yet even in this not
much wrong can be discovered.&nbsp; How far he complied with the
men in power is to be inquired before he can be blamed.&nbsp; It
is not said that he told them any secrets, or assisted them by
intelligence or any other act.&nbsp; If he only promised to be
quiet, that they in whose hands he was might free him from
confinement, he did what no law of society prohibits.</p>
<p>The man whose miscarriage in a just cause has put him in the
power of his enemy, may, without any breach of his integrity,
regain his liberty, or preserve his life, by a promise of
neutrality: for the stipulation gives the enemy nothing which he
had not before.&nbsp; The neutrality of a captive may be always
secured by his imprisonment or death.&nbsp; He that is at the
disposal of another may not promise to aid him in any injurious
act, because no power can compel active obedience.&nbsp; He may
engage to do nothing, but not to do ill.</p>
<p>There is reason to think that Cowley promised little.&nbsp; It
does not appear that his compliance gained him confidence enough
to be trusted without security, for the bond of his bail was
never cancelled; nor that it made him think himself secure, for,
at that dissolution of government which followed the death of
Oliver, he returned into France, where he resumed his former
station, and stayed till the restoration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He continued,&rdquo; says his biographer, &ldquo;under
these bonds till the general deliverance;&rdquo; it is therefore
to be supposed that he did not go to France, and act again for
the king, without the consent of his bondsman: that he did not
show his loyalty at the hazard of his friend, but by his
friend&rsquo;s permission.</p>
<p>Of the verses on Oliver&rsquo;s death, in which Wood&rsquo;s
narrative seems to imply something encomiastic, there has been no
appearance.&nbsp; There is a discourse concerning his government,
indeed, with verses intermixed, but such as certainly gained its
author no friends among the abettors of usurpation.</p>
<p>A doctor of physic, however, he was made at Oxford in
December, 1657; and in the commencement of the Royal Society, of
which an account has been published by Dr. Birch, he appears busy
among the experimental philosophers with the title of Doctor
Cowley.</p>
<p>There is no reason for supposing that he ever attempted
practice: but his preparatory studies have contributed something
to the honour of his country.&nbsp; Considering botany as
necessary to a physician, he retired into Kent to gather plants;
and as the predominance of a favourite study affects all
subordinate operations of the intellect, botany in the mind of
Cowley turned into poetry.&nbsp; He composed, in Latin, several
books on plants, of which the first and second display the
qualities of herbs, in elegiac verse; the third and fourth, the
beauties of flowers, in various measures; and the fifth and
sixth, the use of trees, in heroic numbers.</p>
<p>At the same time were produced, from the same university, the
two great poets, Cowley and Milton, of dissimilar genius, of
opposite principles, but concurring in the cultivation of Latin
poetry; in which the English, till their works and May&rsquo;s
poem appeared, seemed unable to contest the palm with any other
of the lettered nations.</p>
<p>If the Latin performances of Cowley and Milton be compared
(for May I hold to be superior to both), the advantage seems to
lie on the side of Cowley.&nbsp; Milton is generally content to
express the thoughts of the ancients in their language; Cowley,
without much loss of purity or elegance, accommodates the diction
of Rome to his own conceptions.</p>
<p>At the Restoration, after all the diligence of his long
service, and with consciousness, not only of the merit of
fidelity, but of the dignity of great abilities, he naturally
expected ample preferments; and, that he might not be forgotten
by his own fault, wrote a song of triumph.&nbsp; But this was a
time of such general hope, that great numbers were inevitably
disappointed; and Cowley found his reward very tediously
delayed.&nbsp; He had been promised, by both Charles the First
and Second, the mastership of the Savoy; &ldquo;but he lost
it,&rdquo; says Wood, &ldquo;by certain persons, enemies to the
Muses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The neglect of the court was not his only mortification;
having by such alteration as he thought proper, fitted his old
comedy of &ldquo;The Guardian&rdquo; for the stage, he produced
it under the title of &ldquo;The Cutter of Coleman
Street.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was treated on the stage with great
severity, and was afterwards censured as a satire on the
king&rsquo;s party.</p>
<p>Mr. Dryden, who went with Mr. Sprat to the first exhibition,
related to Mr. Dennis, &ldquo;that, when they told Cowley how
little favour had been shown him, he received the news of his ill
success, not with so much firmness as might have been expected
from so great a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What firmness they expected, or what weakness Cowley
discovered, cannot be known.&nbsp; He that misses his end will
never be as much pleased as he that attains it, even when he can
impute no part of his failure to himself; and when the end is to
please the multitude, no man perhaps has a right, in things
admitting of gradation and comparison, to throw the whole blame
upon his judges, and totally to exclude diffidence and shame, by
a haughty consciousness of his own excellence.</p>
<p>For the rejection of this play it is difficult now to find the
reason: it certainly has, in a very great degree, the power of
fixing attention and exciting merriment.&nbsp; From the charge of
disaffection he exculpates himself in his preface, by observing
how unlikely it is, that, having followed the royal family
through all their distresses, &ldquo;he should choose the time of
their restoration to begin a quarrel with them.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
appears, however, from the theatrical register of Downes the
prompter, to have been popularly considered as a satire on the
royalists.</p>
<p>That he might shorten this tedious suspense, he published his
pretensions and his discontent in an ode called &ldquo;The
Complaint;&rdquo; in which he styles himself the
<i>melancholy</i> Cowley.&nbsp; This met with the usual fortune
of complaints, and seems to have excited more contempt than
pity.</p>
<p>These unlucky incidents are brought, maliciously enough,
together in some stanzas, written about that time on the choice
of a laureate; a mode of satire, by which, since it was first
introduced by Suckling, perhaps every generation of poets has
been teased.</p>
<blockquote><p>Savoy-missing Cowley came into the court,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Making apologies for his bad play;<br />
Every one gave him so good a report,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That Apollo gave heed to all he could say:<br />
<br />
Nor would he have had, &rsquo;tis thought, a rebuke,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless he had done some notable folly;<br />
Writ verses unjustly in praise of Sam Tuke,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or printed his pitiful Melancholy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His vehement desire of retirement now came again upon
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not finding,&rdquo; says the morose Wood,
&ldquo;that preferment conferred upon him which he expected,
while others for their money carried away most places, he retired
discontented into Surrey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was now,&rdquo; says the courtly Sprat, &ldquo;weary
of the vexations and formalities of an active condition.&nbsp; He
had been perplexed with a long compliance to foreign
manners.&nbsp; He was satiated with the arts of a court; which
sort of life, though his virtue made it innocent to him, yet
nothing could make it quiet.&nbsp; Those were the reasons that
moved him to follow the violent inclination of his own mind,
which, in the greatest throng of his former business, had still
called upon him, and represented to him the true delights of
solitary studies, of temperate pleasures, and a moderate revenue
below the malice and flatteries of fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So differently are things seen! and so differently are they
shown!&nbsp; But actions are visible, though motives are
secret.&nbsp; Cowley certainly retired; first to Barn Elms, and
afterwards to Chertsey, in Surrey.&nbsp; He seems, however, to
have lost part of his dread of the <i>hum of men</i>.&nbsp; He
thought himself now safe enough from intrusion, without the
defence of mountains and oceans; and, instead of seeking shelter
in America, wisely went only so far from the bustle of life as
that he might easily find his way back when solitude should grow
tedious.&nbsp; His retreat was at first but slenderly
accommodated; yet he soon obtained, by the interest of the Earl
of St. Alban&rsquo;s, and the Duke of Buckingham, such lease of
the queen&rsquo;s lands as afforded him an ample income.</p>
<p>By the lovers of virtue and of wit it will be solicitously
asked, if he now was happy.&nbsp; Let them peruse one of his
letters accidentally preserved by Peck, which I recommend to the
consideration of all that may hereafter pant for solitude.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">To Dr. Thomas Sprat</span>,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<i>Chertsey</i>, <i>May</i>
21, 1665.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first night that I came hither I caught so great a
cold, with a defluxion of rheum, as made me keep my chamber ten
days.&nbsp; And, two after, had such a bruise on my ribs with a
fall, that I am yet unable to move or turn myself in my
bed.&nbsp; This is my personal fortune here to begin with.&nbsp;
And, besides, I can get no money from my tenants, and have my
meadows eaten up every night by cattle put in by my
neighbours.&nbsp; What this signifies, or may come to in time,
God knows; if it be ominous, it can end in nothing less than
hanging.&nbsp; Another misfortune has been, and stranger than all
the rest, that you have broke your word with me and failed to
come, even though you told Mr. Bois that you would.&nbsp; This is
what they call <i>monstri simile</i>.&nbsp; I do hope to recover
my late hurt so far within five or six days (though it be
uncertain yet whether I shall ever recover it) as to walk about
again.&nbsp; And then, methinks, you and I and the dean might be
very merry upon St. Ann&rsquo;s Hill.&nbsp; You might very
conveniently come hither the way of Hampton Town, lying there one
night.&nbsp; I write this in pain, and can say no more: <i>verbum
sapienti</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He did not long enjoy the pleasure or suffer the uneasiness of
solitude; for he died at the Porch-house in Chertsey, in 1667
[28th July], in the forty-ninth year of his age.</p>
<p>He was buried with great pomp near Chaucer and Spenser; and
King Charles pronounced, &ldquo;That Mr. Cowley had not left
behind him a better man in England.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is
represented by Dr. Sprat as the most amiable of mankind; and this
posthumous praise may safely be credited, as it has never been
contradicted by envy or by faction.</p>
<p>Such are the remarks and memorials which I have been able to
add to the narrative of Dr. Sprat; who, writing when the feuds of
civil war were yet recent, and the minds of either party were
easily irritated, was obliged to pass over many transactions in
general expressions, and to leave curiosity often
unsatisfied.&nbsp; What he did not tell cannot, however, now be
known; I must therefore recommend the perusal of his work, to
which my narration can be considered only as a slender
supplement.</p>
<p>Cowley, like other poets who have written with narrow views,
and, instead of tracing intellectual pleasure to its natural
sources in the minds of men, paid their court to temporary
prejudices, has been at one time too much praised, and too much
neglected at another.</p>
<p>Wit, like all other things subject by their nature to the
choice of man, has its changes and fashions, and at different
times takes different forms.&nbsp; About the beginning of the
seventeenth century appeared a race of writers that may be termed
the metaphysical poets; of whom, in a criticism on the works of
Cowley, it is not improper to give some account.</p>
<p>The metaphysical poets were men of learning, and to show their
learning was their whole endeavour; but, unluckily resolving to
show it in rhyme, instead of writing poetry they only wrote
verses, and very often such verses as stood the trial of the
finger better than of the ear; for the modulation was so
imperfect, that they were only found to be verses by counting the
syllables.</p>
<p>If the father of criticism had rightly denominated poetry
&tau;&eacute;&chi;&nu;&eta;
&mu;&iota;&mu;&eta;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#8052;, <i>an imitative
art</i>, these writers will, without great wrong, lose their
right to the name of poets; for they cannot be said to have
imitated anything; they neither copied nature nor life; neither
painted the forms of matter, nor represented the operations of
intellect.</p>
<p>Those, however, who deny them to be poets, allow them to be
wits.&nbsp; Dryden confesses of himself and his contemporaries,
that they fall below Donne in wit; but maintains that they
surpass him in poetry.</p>
<p>If wit be well described by Pope, as being &ldquo;that which
has been often thought, but was never before so well
expressed,&rdquo; they certainly never attained, nor ever sought
it; for they endeavoured to be singular in their thoughts, and
were careless of their diction.&nbsp; But Pope&rsquo;s account of
wit is undoubtedly erroneous; he depresses it below its natural
dignity, and reduces it from strength of thought to happiness of
language.</p>
<p>If by a more noble and more adequate conception, that be
considered as wit which is at once natural and new, that which,
though not obvious, is, upon its first production, acknowledged
to be just; if it be that which he that never found it, wonders
how he missed; to wit of this kind the metaphysical poets have
seldom risen.&nbsp; Their thoughts are often new, but seldom
natural; they are not obvious, but neither are they just; and the
reader, far from wondering that he missed them, wonders more
frequently by what perverseness of industry they were ever
found.</p>
<p>But wit, abstracted from its effects upon the hearer, may be
more rigorously and philosophically considered as a kind of
<i>discordia concors</i>; a combination of dissimilar images, or
discovery of occult resemblances in things apparently
unlike.&nbsp; Of wit, thus defined, they have more than
enough.&nbsp; The most heterogeneous ideas are yoked by violence
together; nature and art are ransacked for illustrations,
comparisons, and allusions; their learning instructs, and their
subtlety surprises; but the reader commonly thinks his
improvement dearly bought, and though he sometimes admires, is
seldom pleased.</p>
<p>From this account of their compositions it will be readily
inferred that they were not successful in representing or moving
the affections.&nbsp; As they were wholly employed on something
unexpected and surprising, they had no regard to that uniformity
of sentiment which enables us to conceive and to excite the pains
and the pleasure of other minds: they never inquired what, on any
occasion, they should have said or done; but wrote rather as
beholders than partakers of human nature; as beings looking upon
good and evil, impassive and at leisure; as epicurean deities,
making remarks on the actions of men, and the vicissitudes of
life, without interest and without emotion.&nbsp; Their courtship
was void of fondness, and their lamentation of sorrow.&nbsp;
Their wish was only to say what they hoped had been never said
before.</p>
<p>Nor was the sublime more within their reach than the pathetic;
for they never attempted that comprehension and expanse of
thought which at once fills the whole mind, and of which the
first effect is sudden astonishment, and the second rational
admiration.&nbsp; Sublimity is produced by aggregation, and
littleness by dispersion.&nbsp; Great thoughts are always
general, and consist in positions not limited by exceptions, and
in descriptions not descending to minuteness.&nbsp; It is with
great propriety that subtlety, which in its original import means
exility of particles, is taken in its metaphorical meaning for
nicety of distinction.&nbsp; Those writers who lay on the watch
for novelty, could have little hope of greatness; for great
things cannot have escaped former observation.&nbsp; Their
attempts were always analytic; they broke every image into
fragments; and could no more represent, by their slender conceits
and laboured particularities, the prospects of nature, or the
scenes of life, than he who dissects a sunbeam with a prism can
exhibit the wide effulgence of a summer noon.</p>
<p>What they wanted, however, of the sublime they endeavoured to
supply by hyperbole; their amplifications had no limits; they
left not only reason but fancy behind them; and produced
combinations of confused magnificence, that not only could not be
credited, but could not be imagined.</p>
<p>Yet great labour, directed by great abilities, is never wholly
lost; if they frequently threw away their wit upon false
conceits, they likewise sometimes struck out unexpected truth; if
their conceits were far fetched, they were often worth the
carriage.&nbsp; To write on their plan, it was at least necessary
to read and think.&nbsp; No man could be born a metaphysical
poet, nor assume the dignity of a writer, by descriptions copied
from descriptions, by imitations borrowed from imitations, by
traditional imagery, and hereditary similes, by readiness of
rhyme, and volubility of syllables.</p>
<p>In perusing the works of this race of authors, the mind is
exercised either by recollection or inquiry; something already
learned is to be retrieved, or something new is to be
examined.&nbsp; If their greatness seldom elevates, their
acuteness often surprises; if the imagination is not always
gratified, at least the powers of reflection and comparison are
employed; and in the mass of materials which ingenious absurdity
has thrown together, genuine wit and useful knowledge may be
sometimes found buried perhaps in grossness of expression, but
useful to those who know their value; and such as, when they are
expanded to perspicuity and polished to elegance, may give lustre
to works which have more propriety though less copiousness of
sentiment.</p>
<p>This kind of writing, which was, I believe, borrowed from
Marino and his followers, had been recommended by the example of
Donne, a man of very extensive and various knowledge, and by
Jonson, whose manner resembled that of Donne more in the
ruggedness of his lines than in the cast of his sentiments.</p>
<p>When their reputation was high, they had undoubtedly more
imitators than time has left behind.&nbsp; Their immediate
successors, of whom any remembrance can be said to remain, were
Suckling, Waller, Denham, Cowley, Clieveland, and Milton.&nbsp;
Denham and Waller sought another way to fame, by improving the
harmony of our members.&nbsp; Milton tried the metaphysic style
only in his lines upon Hobson the carrier.&nbsp; Cowley adopted
it, and excelled his predecessors, having as much sentiment and
more music.&nbsp; Suckling neither improved versification nor
abounded in conceits.&nbsp; The fashionable style remained
chiefly with Cowley; Suckling could not reach it, and Milton
disdained it.</p>
<p>Critical remarks are not easily understood without examples;
and I have therefore collected instances of the modes of writing
by which this species of poets (for poets they were called by
themselves and their admirers) was eminently distinguished.</p>
<p>As the authors of this race were perhaps more desirous of
being admired than understood, they sometimes drew their conceits
from recesses of learning not very much frequented by common
readers of poetry.&nbsp; Thus, Cowley on Knowledge:</p>
<blockquote><p>The sacred tree &rsquo;midst the fair orchard
grew;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The ph&oelig;nix truth did on it rest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And built his perfumed nest,<br />
That right Porphyrian tree which did true logic show.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each leaf did learned notions give,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the apples were demonstrative;<br />
So clear their colour and divine,<br />
The very shads they cast did other lights outshine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Anacreon continuing a lover in his old age:</p>
<blockquote><p>Love was with thy life entwined,<br />
Close as heat with fire is join&rsquo;d;<br />
A powerful brand prescribed the date<br />
Of thine, like Meleager&rsquo;s fate.<br />
Th&rsquo; antiperistasis of age<br />
More enflam&rsquo;d thy amorous rage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the following verses we have an allusion to a rabbinical
opinion concerning manna:</p>
<blockquote><p>Variety I ask not: give me one<br />
To live perpetually upon.<br />
The person Love does to us fit,<br />
Like manna, has the taste of all in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus Donne shows his medicinal knowledge in some encomiastic
verses:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In everything there naturally
grows<br />
A balsamum to keep it fresh and new,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If &rsquo;twere not injured by extrinsic blows:<br
/>
Your youth and beauty are this balm in you.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But you, of learning and religion,<br />
And virtue and such ingredients, have made<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A mithridate, whose operation<br />
Keeps off, or cures what can be done or said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though the following lines of Donne, on the last night of the
year, have something in them too scholastic, they are not
inelegant:</p>
<blockquote><p>This twilight of two years, not past nor next,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some emblem is of me, or I of this,<br />
Who, meteor-like, of stuff and form perplext,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose what and where in disputation is,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If I should call me anything, should miss.<br />
I sum the years and me, and find me not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Debtor to th&rsquo; old, nor creditor to th&rsquo;
new.<br />
That cannot say, my thanks I have forget,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor trust I this with hopes; and yet scarce true<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This bravery is, since these times show&rsquo;d me
you.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Donne</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet more abstruse and profound is Donne&rsquo;s reflection
upon man as a microcosm:</p>
<blockquote><p>If men be worlds, there is in every one<br />
Something to answer in some proportion;<br />
All the world&rsquo;s riches; and in good men, this<br />
Virtue, our form&rsquo;s form, and our soul&rsquo;s soul, is</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of thoughts so far-fetched, as to be not only unexpected, but
unnatural, all their books are full.</p>
<p>To a lady, who wrote posies for rings:</p>
<blockquote><p>They, who above do various circles find,<br />
Say, like a ring, th&rsquo; equator Heaven does bind<br />
When Heaven shall be adorned by thee,<br />
(Which then more Heaven than &rsquo;tis will be)<br />
&rsquo;Tis thou must write the poesy there,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For it wanteth one as yet,<br />
Then the sun pass through&rsquo;t twice a year,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun, which is esteem&rsquo;d the god of
wit.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cowley</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The difficulties which have been raised about identity in
philosophy are by Cowley, with still more perplexity applied to
love:</p>
<blockquote><p>Five years ago (says story) I loved you,<br />
For which you call me most inconstant now;<br />
Pardon me, madam, you mistake the man;<br />
For I am not the same that I was then:<br />
No flesh is now the same &rsquo;twas then in me,<br />
And that my mind is changed yourself may see.<br />
The same thoughts to retain still, and intents<br />
Were more inconstant far; for accidents<br />
Must of all things most strangely inconstant prove,<br />
If from one subject they t&rsquo; another move;<br />
My members then the father members were,<br />
From whence these take their birth, which now are here<br />
If then this body love what th&rsquo; other did,<br />
&rsquo;Twere incest, which by nature is forbid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The love of different women is, in geographical poetry,
compared to travels through different countries:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hast thou not found each woman&rsquo;s breast<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (The land where thou hast travelled)<br />
Either by savages possest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or wild, and uninhabited?<br />
What joy could&rsquo;st take, or what repose,<br />
In countries so uncivilis&rsquo;d as those?<br />
Lust, the scorching dog-star, here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rages with immoderate heat;<br />
Whilst Pride, the ragged northern bear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In others makes the cold too great.<br />
And where these are temperate known,<br />
The soil&rsquo;s all barren sand, or rocky stone.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Cowley</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lover, burnt up by his affection, is compared to Egypt:</p>
<blockquote><p>The fate of Egypt I sustain,<br />
And never feel the dew of rain,<br />
From clouds which in the head appear;<br />
But all my too-much moisture ewe<br />
To overflowings of the heart below.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Cowley</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lover supposes his lady acquainted with the ancient laws
of augury and rites of sacrifice:</p>
<blockquote><p>And yet this death of mine, I fear,<br />
Will ominous to her appear:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When, sound in every other part,<br />
Her sacrifice is found without an heart.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the last tempest of my death<br />
Shall sigh out that too, with my breath.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That the chaos was harmonised, has been recited of old; but
whence the different sounds arose remained for a modern to
discover:</p>
<blockquote><p>Th&rsquo; ungovern&rsquo;d parts no correspondence
knew;<br />
An artless war from thwarting motions grew;<br />
Till they to number and fixed rules were brought.<br />
Water and air he for the tenor chose,<br />
Earth made the base; the treble flame arose.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Cowley</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tears of lovers are always of great poetical account; but
Donne has extended them into worlds.&nbsp; If the lines are not
easily understood, they may be read again:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
a round ball<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A workman, that hath copies by, can lay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An Europe, Afric, and an Asia,<br />
And quickly make that which was nothing, all.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So doth each tear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which thee doth wear,<br />
A globe, yea world, by that impression grow,<br />
Till thy tears mixed with mine do overflow<br />
This world, by waters sent from thee my heaven dissolved so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On reading the following lines, the reader may perhaps cry out
&ldquo;Confusion worse confounded.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>Hers lies a she sun, and a he moon here,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She gives the best light to his sphere,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or each is both, and all, and so,<br />
They unto one another nothing owe.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Donne</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who but Donne would have thought that a good man is a
telescope?</p>
<blockquote><p>Though God be our true glass through which we
see<br />
All, since the being of all things is He,<br />
Yet are the trunks, which do to us derive<br />
Things in proportion fit, by perspective<br />
Deeds of good men; for by their living here,<br />
Virtues, indeed remote, seem to be near.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who would imagine it possible that in a very few lines so many
remote ideas could be brought together?</p>
<blockquote><p>Since &rsquo;tis my doom, love&rsquo;s
undershrieve,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why this reprieve?<br />
Why doth my she advowson fly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incumbency?<br />
To sell thyself dust thou intend<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By candles end,<br />
And hold the contract thus in doubt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life&rsquo;s taper out?<br />
Think but how soon the market fails,<br />
Your sex lives faster than the males;<br />
And if to measure age&rsquo;s span,<br />
The sober Julian were th&rsquo; account of man,<br />
Whilst you live by the fleet Gregorian.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Cleveland</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of enormous and disgusting hyperboles, these may be
examples:</p>
<blockquote><p>By every wind that comes this way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Send me at least a sigh or two,<br />
Such and so many I&rsquo;ll repay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As shall themselves make winds to get to
you.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cowley</span>.</p>
<p>In tears I&rsquo;ll waste these eyes,<br />
By love so vainly fed:<br />
So lust of old the deluge punished.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Cowley</span>.</p>
<p>All arm&rsquo;d in brass, the richest dress of war,<br />
(A dismal glorious sight!) he shone afar.<br />
The sun himself started with sudden fright,<br />
To see his beams return so dismal bright.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Cowley</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A universal consternation:</p>
<blockquote><p>His bloody eyes he hurls round, his sharp paws<br
/>
Tear up the ground; then runs he wild about,<br />
Lashing his angry tail and roaring out.<br />
Beasts creep into their dens, and tremble there;<br />
Trees, though no wind is stirring, shake with fear;<br />
Silence and horror fill the place around;<br />
Echo itself dares scarce repeat the sound.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Cowley</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their fictions were often violent and unnatural.</p>
<p>Of his mistress bathing:</p>
<blockquote><p>The fish around her crowded, as they do<br />
To the false light that treacherous fishers show,<br />
And all with as much ease might taken be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As she at first took me;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For ne&rsquo;er did light so clear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the waves appear,<br />
Though every night the sun himself set there.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Cowley</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The poetical effect of a lover&rsquo;s name upon glass:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name engraved herein<br />
Both contribute my firmness to this glass:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which, ever since that charm, hath been<br />
As hard as that which graved it was.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Donne</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their conceits were sometimes slight and trifling.&nbsp; On an
inconstant woman:</p>
<blockquote><p>He enjoys the calmy sunshine now,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And no breath stirring hears,<br />
In the clear heaven of thy brow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No smallest cloud appears.<br />
He sees thee gentle, fair and gay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And trusts the faithless April of thy
May.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cowley</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon a paper written with the juice of lemon, and read by the
fire:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing yet in thee is seen,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; But when a genial heat warms thee within,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A new-born wood of various lines there grows;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hers buds an L, and there a B,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here sprouts a V, and there a T,<br />
And all the flourishing letters stand in rows.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Cowley</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As they sought only for novelty, they did not much inquire
whether their allusions were to things high or low, elegant or
gross; whether they compared the little to the great, or the
great to the little.</p>
<p>Physic and chirurgery for a lover:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently, ah gently, madam,
touch<br />
The wound, which you yourself have made;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That pain must needs be very much<br />
Which makes me of your hand afraid.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cordials of pity give me now,<br />
For I too weak of purgings grow.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Cowley</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The world and a clock</p>
<blockquote><p>Mahol th&rsquo; inferior world&rsquo;s fantastic
face<br />
Through all the turns of matter&rsquo;s maze did trace;<br />
Great Nature&rsquo;s well-set clock in pieces took;<br />
On all the springs and smallest wheels did look<br />
Of life and motion, and with equal art<br />
Made up the whole again of every part.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Cowley</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A coal-pit has not often found its poet; but, that it may not
want its due honour, Cleveland has paralleled it with the
sun:</p>
<blockquote><p>The moderate value of our guiltless ore<br />
Makes no man atheist, and no woman whore;<br />
Yet why should hallow&rsquo;d vestal&rsquo;s sacred shrine<br />
Deserve more honour than a flaming mine?<br />
These pregnant wombs of heat would fitter be,<br />
Than a few embers, for a deity.<br />
Had he our pits, the Persian would admire<br />
No sun, but warm&rsquo;s devotion at our fire:<br />
He&rsquo;d leave the trotting whipster, and prefer<br />
Our profound Vulcan &rsquo;bove that waggoner.<br />
For wants he heat, or light? or would have store<br />
Of both? &rsquo;tis here: and what can suns give more?<br />
Nay, what&rsquo;s the sun but, in a different name,<br />
A coal-pit rampant, or a mine on flame?<br />
Then let this truth reciprocally run,<br />
The sun&rsquo;s heaven&rsquo;s coalery, and coals our sun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Death, a voyage:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No family<br
/>
E&rsquo;er rigg&rsquo;d a soul for Heaven&rsquo;s discovery,<br
/>
With whom more venturers might boldly dare<br />
Venture their stakes with him in joy to share.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Donne</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their thoughts and expressions were sometimes grossly absurd,
and such as no figures or licence can reconcile to the
understanding.</p>
<p>A lover neither dead nor alive:</p>
<blockquote><p>Then down I laid my head<br />
Down on cold earth; and for a while was dead,<br />
And my freed soul to a strange somewhere fled.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, sottish soul, said I,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When back to its cage again I saw it fly;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fool to resume her broken chain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And row her galley here again!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fool, to that body to return<br />
Where it condemned and destined is to burn!<br />
Once dead, how can it be,<br />
Death should a thing so pleasant seem to thee,<br />
That thou should&rsquo;st come to live it o&rsquo;er again in
me?&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cowley</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lover&rsquo;s heart, a hand grenado:</p>
<blockquote><p>Woe to her stubborn heart, if once mine come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into the self same room;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twill tear and blow up all within,<br />
Like a grenade shot into a magazine.<br />
Then shall Love keep the ashes and torn parts,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of both our broken hearts;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shalt out of both one new one make;<br />
From hers th&rsquo; allay, from mine the metal take.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Cowley</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The poetical propagation of light:</p>
<blockquote><p>The prince&rsquo;s favour is diffused o&rsquo;er
all,<br />
From which all fortunes names, and natures fall:<br />
Then from those wombs of stars, the Bride&rsquo;s bright eyes,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; At every glance a constellation flies,<br />
And sows the court with stars, and doth prevent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In light and power, the all-ey&rsquo;d firmament:<br
/>
First her eye kindles other ladies&rsquo; eyes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then from their beams their jewels&rsquo; lustres
rise;<br />
And from their jewels torches do take fire,<br />
And all is warmth, and light, and good desire.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Donne</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They were in very little care to clothe their notions with
elegance of dress, and therefore miss the notice and the praise
which are often gained by those who think less, but are more
diligent to adorn their thoughts.</p>
<p>That a mistress beloved is fairer in idea than in reality is
by Cowley thus expressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thou in my fancy dost much higher stand<br />
Than woman can be placed by Nature&rsquo;s hand;<br />
And I must needs, I&rsquo;m sure, a loser be,<br />
To change thee as thou&rsquo;rt there, for very thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That prayer and labour should co-operate are thus taught by
Donne:</p>
<blockquote><p>In none but us are such mix&rsquo;d engines
found,<br />
As hands of double office; for the ground<br />
We till with them; and them to heaven we raise<br />
Who prayerless labours, or, without this, prays,<br />
Doth but one half, that&rsquo;s none.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the same author, a common topic, the danger of
procrastination, is thus illustrated:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That which I should have
begun<br />
In my youth&rsquo;s morning, now late must be done;<br />
And I, as giddy travellers must do,<br />
Which stray or sleep all day, and having lost<br />
Light and strength, dark and tired, must then ride post.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All that man has to do is to live and die; the sum of humanity
is comprehended by Donne in the following lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>Think in how poor a prison thou didst lie<br />
After enabled but to suck and cry.<br />
Think, when &rsquo;twas grown to most, &rsquo;twas a poor inn,<br
/>
A province pack&rsquo;d up in two yards of skin,<br />
And that usurp&rsquo;d, or threaten&rsquo;d with a rage<br />
Of sicknesses or their true mother, age.<br />
But think that death hath now enfranchised thee;<br />
Thou hast thy expansion now, and liberty;<br />
Think, that a rusty piece discharged is flown<br />
In pieces, and the bullet is his own,<br />
And freely flies: this to thy soul allow,<br />
Think thy shell broke, think thy soul hatch&rsquo;d but now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They were sometimes indelicate and disgusting.&nbsp; Cowley
thus apostrophises beauty:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou tyrant which leav&rsquo;st
no man free!<br />
Thou subtle thief, from whom nought safe can be!<br />
Thou murtherer, which has kill&rsquo;d, and devil, which
would&rsquo;st damn me!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus he addresses his mistress:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thou who, in many a propriety,<br />
So truly art the sun to me,<br />
Add one more likeness, which I&rsquo;m sure you can,<br />
And let me and my sun beget a man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus he represents the meditations of a lover:</p>
<blockquote><p>Though in thy thoughts scarce any tracts have
been<br />
So much as of original sin,<br />
Such charms thy beauty wears, as might<br />
Desires in dying confest saints excite.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou with strange adultery<br />
Dost in each breast a brothel keep;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Awake all men do lust for thee,<br />
And some enjoy thee when they sleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The true taste of tears:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hither with crystal vials, lovers, come,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And take my tears, which are love&rsquo;s wine,<br
/>
And try your mistress&rsquo; tears at home;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For all are false, that taste not just like
mine.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Donne</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is yet more indelicate:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the sweet sweat of roses in a still,<br />
As that which from chas&rsquo;d musk-cat&rsquo;s pores doth
trill,<br />
As th&rsquo; almighty balm of th&rsquo; early east;<br />
Such are the sweet drops of my mistress&rsquo; breast.<br />
And on her neck her skin such lustre sets,<br />
They seem no sweat drops, but pearl coronets:<br />
Rank, sweaty froth thy mistress&rsquo; brow defiles.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Donne</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their expressions sometimes raise horror, when they intend
perhaps to be pathetic:</p>
<blockquote><p>As men in hell are from diseases free,<br />
So from all other ills am I,<br />
Free from their known formality:<br />
But all pains eminently lie in thee.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Cowley</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They were not always strictly curious, whether the opinions
from which they drew their illustrations were true; it was enough
that they were popular.&nbsp; Bacon remarks, that some falsehoods
are continued by tradition, because they supply commodious
allusions.</p>
<blockquote><p>It gave a piteous groan, and so it broke:<br />
In vain it something would have spoke;<br />
The love within too strong for&rsquo;t was,<br />
Like poison put into a Venice-glass.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Cowley</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In forming descriptions, they looked out not for images, but
for conceits.&nbsp; Night has been a common subject, which poets
have contended to adorn.&nbsp; Dryden&rsquo;s Night is well
known; Donne&rsquo;s is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thou seest me here at midnight, now all rest:<br
/>
Time&rsquo;s dead low-water; when all minds divest<br />
To-morrow&rsquo;s business; when the labourers have<br />
Such rest in bed, that their last church-yard grave,<br />
Subject to change, will scarce be a type of this;<br />
Now when the client, whose last hearing is<br />
To-morrow, sleeps; when the condemned man,<br />
Who, when he opes his eyes, must shut them the<br />
Again by death, although sad watch he keep;<br />
Doth practise dying by a little sleep:<br />
Thou at this midnight seest me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It must be, however, confessed of these writers, that if they
are upon common subjects often unnecessarily and unpoetically
subtle; yet, where scholastic speculation can be properly
admitted, their copiousness and acuteness may justly be
admired.&nbsp; What Cowley has written upon Hope shows an
unequalled fertility of invention:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hops, whose weak being mind
is,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Alike if it succeed and if it miss;<br />
Whom good or ill does equally confound,<br />
And both the horns of fate&rsquo;s dilemma wound;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Vain shadow! which dust vanish quite,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Both at full noon and perfect night!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The stars have not a possibility<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of blessing thee;<br />
If things then from their end we happy call<br />
&rsquo;Tis Hope is the most hopeless thing of all.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope, thou bold tester of delight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who, whilst thou shouldst but taste, devour&rsquo;st
it quite!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou bring&rsquo;st us an estate, yet leav&rsquo;st
us poor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By clogging it with legacies before!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The joys, which we entire should wed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Come deflowr&rsquo;d virgins to our bed;<br />
Good fortunes without gain imported be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such mighty custom&rsquo;s paid to thee:<br />
For joy, like wine kept close, does better taste<br />
If it take air before its spirits waste.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the following comparison of a man that travels, and his
wife that stays at home, with a pair of compasses, it may be
doubted whether absurdity or ingenuity has the better claim:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our two souls, therefore, which are one,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though I must go, endure not yet<br />
A breach, but an expansion,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like gold to airy thinness beat.<br />
If they be two, they are two so<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As stiff twin compasses are two;<br />
Thy soul, the fix&rsquo;d foot, makes no show<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To move, but doth if th&rsquo; other do.<br />
And, though it in the centre sit,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, when the other far doth roam,<br />
It leans and hearkens after it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And grows erect as that comes home.<br />
Such wilt thou be to me, who must<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like th&rsquo; other foot obliquely run.<br />
Thy firmness makes my circle just,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And makes me end where I begun.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Donne</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In all these examples it is apparent, that whatever is
improper or vicious, is produced by a voluntary deviation from
nature in pursuit of something new and strange; and that the
writers fail to give delight, by their desire of exciting
admiration.</p>
<p>Having thus endeavoured to exhibit a general representation of
the style and sentiments of the metaphysical poets, it is now
proper to examine particularly the works of Cowley, who was
almost the last of that race, and undoubtedly the best.</p>
<p>His Miscellanies contain a collection of short compositions,
written some as they were dictated by a mind at leisure, and some
as they were called forth by different occasions; with great
variety of style and sentiment, from burlesque levity to awful
grandeur.&nbsp; Such an assemblage of diversified excellence no
other poet has hitherto afforded.&nbsp; To choose the best, among
many good, is one of the most hazardous attempts of
criticism.&nbsp; I know not whether Scaliger himself has
persuaded many readers to join with him in his preference of the
two favourite odes, which he estimates in his raptures at the
value of a kingdom.&nbsp; I will, however, venture to recommend
Cowley&rsquo;s first piece, which ought to be inscribed &ldquo;To
my Muse,&rdquo; for want of which the second couplet is without
reference.&nbsp; When the title is added, there wills till remain
a defect; for every piece ought to contain in itself whatever is
necessary to make it intelligible.&nbsp; Pope has some epitaphs
without names; which are therefore epitaphs to be let, occupied
indeed for the present, but hardly appropriated.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Ode on Wit&rdquo; is almost without a rival.&nbsp;
It was about the time of Cowley that <i>wit</i>, which had been
till then used for <i>intellection</i>, in contradistinction to
<i>will</i>, took the meaning, whatever it be, which it now
bears.</p>
<p>Of all the passages in which poets have exemplified their own
precepts, none will easily be found of greater excellence than
that in which Cowley condemns exuberance of wit:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Yet &rsquo;tis not to adorn and gild each part,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; That shows more cost than art.<br />
Jewels at nose and lips but ill appear;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather than all things wit, let none be there.<br />
Several lights will not be seen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If there be nothing else between.<br />
Men doubt, because they stand so thick i&rsquo; th&rsquo; sky,<br
/>
If those be stars which paint the galaxy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his verses to Lord Falkland, whom every man of his time was
proud to praise, there are, as there must be in all
Cowley&rsquo;s compositions, some striking thoughts, but they are
not well wrought.&nbsp; His &ldquo;Elegy on Sir Henry
Wotton&rdquo; is vigorous and happy; the series of thoughts is
easy and natural; and the conclusion, though a little weakened by
the intrusion of Alexander, is elegant and forcible.</p>
<p>It may be remarked, that in this elegy, and in most of his
encomiastic poems, he has forgotten or neglected to name his
heroes.</p>
<p>In his poem on the death of Hervey, there is much praise, but
little passion; a very just and ample delineation of such virtues
as a studious privacy admits, and such intellectual excellence as
a mind not yet called forth to action can display.&nbsp; He knew
how to distinguish, and how to commend, the qualities of his
companion; but, when he wishes to make us weep, he forgets to
weep himself, and diverts his sorrow by imagining how his crown
of bays, if he had it, would crackle in the fire.&nbsp; It is the
odd fate of this thought to be the worse for being true.&nbsp;
The bay-leaf crackles remarkably as it burns; as therefore this
property was not assigned it by chance, the mind must be thought
sufficiently at ease that could attend to such minuteness of
physiology.&nbsp; But the power of Cowley is not so much to move
the affections, as to exercise the understanding.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Chronicle&rdquo; is a composition unrivalled and
alone: such gaiety of fancy, such facility of expression, such
varied similitude, such a succession of images, and such a dance
of words, it is in vain to expect except from Cowley.&nbsp; His
strength always appears in his agility; his volatility is not the
flutter of a light, but the bound of an elastic mind.&nbsp; His
levity never leaves his learning behind it; the moralist, the
politician, and the critic, mingle their influence even in this
airy frolic of genius.&nbsp; To such a performance Suckling could
have brought the gaiety, but not the knowledge; Dryden could have
supplied the knowledge, but not the gaiety.</p>
<p>The verses to Davenant, which are vigorously begun, and
happily concluded, contain some hints of criticism very justly
conceived and happily expressed.&nbsp; Cowley&rsquo;s critical
abilities have not been sufficiently observed: the few decisions
and remarks, which his prefaces and his notes on the
&ldquo;Davideis&rdquo; supply, were at that time accessions to
English literature, and show such skill as raises our wish for
more examples.</p>
<p>The lines from Jersey are a very curious and pleasing specimen
of the familiar descending to the burlesque.</p>
<p>His two metrical disquisitions <i>for</i> and <i>against</i>
Reason are no mean specimens of metaphysical poetry.&nbsp; The
stanzas against knowledge produce little conviction.&nbsp; In
those which are intended to exalt the human faculties, Reason has
its proper task assigned it; that of judging, not of things
revealed, but of the reality of revelation.&nbsp; In the verses
<i>for</i> Reason is a passage which Bentley, in the only English
verses which he is known to have written, seems to have copied,
though with the inferiority of an imitator.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Holy Book like the eighth sphere doth shine<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; With thousand lights of truth divine,<br />
So numberless the stars, that to our eye<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It makes all but one galaxy.<br />
Yet Reason must assist too; for, in seas<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So vast and dangerous as these,<br />
Our course by stars above we cannot know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Without the compass too below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this says Bentley:</p>
<blockquote><p>Who travels in religious jars,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Truth mix&rsquo;d with error, shade with rays<br />
Like Whiston wanting pyx or stars,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In ocean wide or sinks or strays.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cowley seems to have had what Milton is believed to have
wanted, the skill to rate his own performances by their just
value, and has therefore closed his Miscellanies with the verses
upon Crashaw, which apparently excel all that have gone before
them, and in which there are beauties which common authors may
justly think not only above their attainment, but above their
ambition.</p>
<p>To the Miscellanies succeed the Anacreontics, or
paraphrastical translations of some little poems, which pass,
however justly, under the name of Anacreon.&nbsp; Of those songs
dedicated to festivity and gaiety, in which even the morality is
voluptuous, and which teach nothing but the enjoyment of the
present day, he has given rather a pleasing than a faithful
representation, having retained their sprightliness, but lost
their simplicity.&nbsp; The Anacreon of Cowley, like the Homer of
Pope, has admitted the decoration of some modern graces, by which
he is undoubtedly made more amiable to common readers, and
perhaps, if they would honestly declare their own perceptions, to
far the greater part of those whom courtesy and ignorance are
content to style the learned.</p>
<p>These little pieces will be found more finished in their kind
than any other of Cowley&rsquo;s works.&nbsp; The diction shows
nothing of the mould of time, and the sentiments are at no great
distance from our present habitudes of thought.&nbsp; Real mirth
must always be natural, and nature is uniform.&nbsp; Men have
been wise in very different modes; but they have always laughed
the same way.</p>
<p>Levity of thought naturally produces familiarity of language,
and the familiar part of language continues long the same; the
dialogue of comedy when it is transcribed from popular manners
and real life, is read from age to age with equal pleasure.&nbsp;
The artifices of inversion by which the established order of
words is changed, or of innovation, by which new words, or new
meanings of words, are introduced, is practised, not by those who
talk to be understood, but by those who write to be admired.</p>
<p>The Anacreontics, therefore, of Cowley, give now all the
pleasure which they ever gave.&nbsp; If he was formed by nature
for one kind of writing more than for another, his power seems to
have been greatest in the familiar and the festive.</p>
<p>The next class of his poems is called &ldquo;The
Mistress,&rdquo; of which it is not necessary to select any
particular pieces for praise or censure.&nbsp; They have all the
same beauties and faults, and nearly in the same
proportion.&nbsp; They are written with exuberance of wit, and
with copiousness of learning; and it is truly asserted by Sprat,
that the plenitude of the writer&rsquo;s knowledge flows in upon
his page, so that the reader is commonly surprised into some
improvement.&nbsp; But, considered as the verses of a lover, no
man that has ever loved will much commend them.&nbsp; They are
neither courtly nor pathetic, have neither gallantry nor
fondness.&nbsp; His praises are too far sought, and too
hyperbolical, either to express love, or to excite it; every
stanza is crowded with darts and flames, with wounds and death,
with mingled souls and with broken hearts.</p>
<p>The principal artifice by which &ldquo;The Mistress&rdquo; is
filled with conceits is very copiously displayed by
Addison.&nbsp; Love is by Cowley, as by other poets, expressed
metaphorically by flame and fire; and that which is true of real
fire is said of love, or figurative fire, the same word in the
same sentence retaining both significations.&nbsp; Thus
&ldquo;observing the cold regard of his mistress&rsquo;s eyes,
and at the same time their power of producing love in him, he
considers them as burning-glasses made of ice.&nbsp; Finding
himself able to live in the greatest extremities of love, he
concludes the torrid zone to be habitable.&nbsp; Upon the dying
of a tree, on which he had cut his loves, he observes that his
flames had burnt up and withered the tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These conceits Addison calls mixed wit; that is, wit which
consists of thoughts true in one sense of the expression, and
false in the other.&nbsp; Addison&rsquo;s representation is
sufficiently indulgent: that confusion of images may entertain
for a moment; but being unnatural it soon grows wearisome.&nbsp;
Cowley delighted in it, as much as if he had invented it; but,
not to mention the ancients, he might have found it full-blown in
modern Italy.&nbsp; Thus Sannazaro:</p>
<blockquote><p>Aspice quam variis distringar Lesbia curis!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Uror, et heu! nostro manat ab igne liquor:<br />
Sum Nilus, sumque &AElig;tna simul; restringite flammas<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O lacrim&aelig;, aut lacrimas ebibe flamma meas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the severe theologians of that time censured him as
having published a book of profane and lascivious verses.&nbsp;
From the charge of profaneness, the constant tenor of his life,
which seems to have been eminently virtuous, and the general
tendency of his opinions, which discover no irreverence of
religion, must defend him; but that the accusation of
lasciviousness is unjust, the perusal of his works will
sufficiently evince.</p>
<p>Cowley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mistress&rdquo; has no power of
seduction: she &ldquo;plays round the head, but comes not at the
heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her beauty and absence, her kindness and
cruelty, her disdain and inconstancy, produce no correspondence
of emotion.&nbsp; His poetical accounts of the virtues of plants,
and colours of flowers, is not perused with more sluggish
frigidity.&nbsp; The compositions are such as might have been
written for penance by a hermit, or for hire by a philosophical
rhymer who had only heard of another sex; for they turn the mind
only on the writer, whom, without thinking on a woman but as the
subject for his task, we sometimes esteem as learned, and
sometimes despise as trifling, always admire as ingenious, and
always condemn as unnatural.</p>
<p>The Pindaric Odes are now to be considered; a species of
composition, which Cowley thinks Pancirolus might have counted in
his list of the lost inventions of antiquity, and which he has
made a bold and vigorous attempt to recover.</p>
<p>The purpose with which he has paraphrased an Olympic and
Nem&aelig;an Ode is by himself sufficiently explained.&nbsp; His
endeavour was, not to show precisely what Pindar spoke, but his
manner of speaking.&nbsp; He was therefore not at all restrained
to his expressions, nor much to his sentiments; nothing was
required of him, but not to write as Pindar would not have
written.</p>
<p>Of the Olympic Ode the beginning is, I think, above the
original in elegance, and the conclusion below it in
strength.&nbsp; The connection is supplied with great
perspicuity; and the thoughts, which to a reader of less skill
seem thrown together by chance, are concatenated without any
abruption.&nbsp; Though the English ode cannot be called a
translation, it may be very properly consulted as a
commentary.</p>
<p>The spirit of Pindar is indeed not everywhere equally
preserved.&nbsp; The following pretty lines are not such as his
&ldquo;deep mouth&rdquo; was used to pour:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Rhea&rsquo;s son,<br />
If in Olympus&rsquo; top, where thou<br />
Sitt&rsquo;st to behold thy sacred show,<br />
If in Alpheus&rsquo; silver flight,<br />
If in my verse thou take delight,<br />
My verse, great Rhea&rsquo;s son, which is<br />
Lofty as that and smooth as this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Nem&aelig;an Ode, the reader must, in mere justice to
Pindar, observe, whatever is said of the original new moon, her
tender forehead and her horns, is superadded by his paraphrast,
who has many other plays of words and fancy unsuitable to the
original, as,</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table, free for ev&rsquo;ry
guest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No doubt will thee admit,<br />
And feast more upon thee, than thou on it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He sometimes extends his author&rsquo;s thoughts without
improving them.&nbsp; In the Olympionic an oath is mentioned in a
single word, and Cowley spends three lines in swearing by the
Castalian Stream.&nbsp; We are told of Theron&rsquo;s bounty,
with a hint that he had enemies, which Cowley thus enlarges in
rhyming prose:</p>
<blockquote><p>But in this thankless world the giver<br />
Is envied even by the receiver;<br />
&rsquo;Tis now the cheap and frugal fashion<br />
Rather to hide than own the obligation:<br />
Nay, &rsquo;tis much worse than so;<br />
It now an artifice does grow<br />
Wrongs and injuries to do,<br />
Lest men should think we owe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is hard to conceive that a man of the first rank in
learning and wit, when he was dealing out such minute morality in
such feeble diction, could imagine, either waking or dreaming,
that he imitated Pindar.</p>
<p>In the following odes, where Cowley chooses his own subjects,
he sometimes rises to dignity truly Pindaric; and, if some
deficiencies of language be forgiven, his strains are such as
those of the Theban bard were to his contemporaries:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begin the song, and strike the
living lyre:<br />
Lo how the years to come, a numerous and well-fitted quire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All hand in hand do decently advance,<br />
And to my song with smooth and equal measure dance;<br />
While the dance lasts, how long soe&rsquo;er it be,<br />
My music&rsquo;s voice shall bear it company;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till all gentle notes be drown&rsquo;d<br />
In the last trumpet&rsquo;s dreadful sound.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After such enthusiasm, who will not lament to find the poet
conclude with lines like these:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But stop, my Muse&mdash;<br />
Hold thy Pindaric Pegasus closely in,<br />
Which does to rage begin&mdash;<br />
&mdash;&rsquo;Tis an unruly and hard-mouth&rsquo;d
horse&mdash;<br />
&rsquo;Twill no unskilful touch endure,<br />
But flings writer and reader too that sits not sure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fault of Cowley, and perhaps of all the writers of the
metaphysical race, is that of pursuing his thoughts to their last
ramifications, by which he loses the grandeur of generality; for
of the greatest things the parts are little; what is little can
be but pretty, and by claiming dignity becomes ridiculous.&nbsp;
Thus all the power of description is destroyed by a scrupulous
enumeration, and the force of metaphors is lost, when the mind by
the mention of particulars is turned more upon the original than
the secondary sense, more upon that from which the illustration
is drawn than that to which it is applied.</p>
<p>Of this we have a very eminent example in the ode entitled the
&ldquo;Muse,&rdquo; who goes to &ldquo;take the air&rdquo; in an
intellectual chariot, to which he harnesses Fancy and Judgment,
Wit and Eloquence, Memory and Invention; how he distinguished Wit
from Fancy, or how Memory could properly contribute to Motion, he
has not explained: we are however content to suppose that he
could have justified his own fiction, and wish to see the Muse
begin her career; but there is yet more to be done.</p>
<blockquote><p>Let the <i>postillion</i> Nature mount, and let<br
/>
The <i>coachman</i> Art be set;<br />
And let the airy <i>footmen</i>, running all beside,<br />
Make a long row of goodly pride;<br />
Figures, conceits, raptures, and sentences,<br />
In a well-worded dress,<br />
And innocent loves, and pleasant truths, and useful lies,<br />
In all their gaudy <i>liveries</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every mind is now disgusted with this cumber of magnificence;
yet I cannot refuse myself the four next lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mount, glorious queen, thy travelling throne,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bid it to put on;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For long though cheerful is the way,<br />
And life, alas! allows but one ill winter&rsquo;s day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same ode, celebrating the power of the Muse, he gives
her prescience, or, in poetical language, the foresight of events
hatching in futurity; but, once having an egg in his mind, he
cannot forbear to show us that he knows what an egg contains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thou into the close nests of Time dost peep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And there with piercing eye<br />
Through the firm shell and the thick white float spy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Years to come a-forming lie,<br />
Close in their sacred fecundine asleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same thought is more generally, and therefore more
poetically expressed by Casimir, a writer who has many of the
beauties and faults of Cowley:</p>
<blockquote><p>Omnibus mundi Dominator horis<br />
Aptat urgendas per inane pennas,<br />
Pars adhuc nido latet, et futuros<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crescit in annos.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cowley, whatever was his subject, seems to have been carried,
by a kind of destiny, to the light and the familiar, or to
conceits which require still more ignoble epithets.&nbsp; A
slaughter in the Red Sea &ldquo;new dyes the water&rsquo;s
name;&rdquo; and England, during the Civil War, was &ldquo;Albion
no more, nor to be named from white.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is surely by
some fascination not easily surmounted, that a writer, professing
to revive &ldquo;the noblest and highest writing in verse,&rdquo;
makes this address to the new year:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nay, if thou lov&rsquo;st me, gentle year,<br />
Let not so much as love be there,<br />
Vain, fruitless love I mean; for, gentle year,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Although I fear<br />
There&rsquo;s of this caution little need,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, gentle year, take heed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How thou dost make<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a mistake;<br />
Such love I mean alone<br />
As by thy cruel predecessors has been shown:<br />
For, though I have too much cause to doubt it,<br />
I fain would try, for once, if life can live without it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reader of this will be inclined to cry out with
Prior&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye critics, say,<br />
How poor to this was Pindar&rsquo;s style!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even those who cannot perhaps find in the Isthmian or
Nem&aelig;an songs what Antiquity what disposed them to expect,
will at least see that they are ill represented by such puny
poetry; and all will determine that, if this be the old Theban
strain, it is not worthy of revival.</p>
<p>To the disproportion and incongruity of Cowley&rsquo;s
sentiments must be added the uncertainty and looseness of his
measures.&nbsp; He takes the liberty of using in any place a
verse of any length, from two syllables to twelve.&nbsp; The
verses of Pindar have, as he observes, very little harmony to a
modern ear; yet by examining the syllables we perceive them to be
regular, and have reason enough for supposing that the ancient
audiences were delighted with the sound.&nbsp; The imitator ought
therefore to have adopted what he found, and to have added what
was wanting; to have preserved a constant return of the same
numbers, and to have supplied smoothness of transition and
continuity of thought.</p>
<p>It is urged by Dr. Sprat, that the &ldquo;irregularity of
numbers is the very thing&rdquo; which makes &ldquo;that kind of
poesy fit for all manner of subjects.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he should
have remembered, that what is fit for everything can fit nothing
well.&nbsp; The great pleasure of verse arises from the known
measure of the lines, and uniform structure of the stanzas, by
which the voice is regulated, and the memory relieved.</p>
<p>If the Pindaric style be, what Cowley thinks it, &ldquo;the
highest and noblest kind of writing in verse,&rdquo; it can be
adapted only to high and noble subjects; and it will not be easy
to reconcile the poet with the critic, or to conceive how that
can be the highest kind of writing in verse which, according to
Sprat, &ldquo;is chiefly to be preferred for its near affinity to
prose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This lax and lawless versification so much concealed the
deficiencies of the barren, and flattered the laziness of the
idle, that it immediately overspread our books of poetry; all the
boys and girls caught the pleasing fashion, and they that could
do nothing else could write like Pindar.&nbsp; The rights of
antiquity were invaded, and disorder tried to break into the
Latin: a poem on the Sheldonian Theatre, in which all kinds of
verse are shaken together, is unhappily inserted in the
&ldquo;Mus&aelig; Anglican&aelig;.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pindarism
prevailed about half a century; but at last died gradually away,
and other imitations supply its place.</p>
<p>The Pindaric Odes have so long enjoyed the highest degree of
poetical reputation, that I am not willing to dismiss them with
unabated censure; and surely though the mode of their composition
be erroneous, yet many parts deserve at least that admiration
which is due to great comprehension of knowledge, and great
fertility of fancy.&nbsp; The thoughts are often new, and often
striking; but the greatness of one part is disgraced by the
littleness of another; and total negligence of language gives the
noblest conceptions the appearance of a fabric august in the
plan, but mean in the materials.&nbsp; Yet surely those verses
are not without a just claim to praise; of which it may be said
with truth, that no man but Cowley could have written them.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Davideis&rdquo; now remains to be considered; a
poem which the author designed to have extended to twelve books,
merely, as he makes no scruple of declaring, because the
&ldquo;&AElig;neid&rdquo; had that number; but he had leisure or
perseverance only to write the third part.&nbsp; Epic poems have
been left unfinished by Virgil, Statius, Spenser, and
Cowley.&nbsp; That we have not the whole &ldquo;Davideis&rdquo;
is, however, not much to be regretted; for in this undertaking
Cowley is, tacitly at least, confessed to have miscarried.&nbsp;
There are not many examples of so great a work produced by an
author generally read, and generally praised, that has crept
through a century with so little regard.&nbsp; Whatever is said
of Cowley, is meant of his other works.&nbsp; Of the
&ldquo;Davideis&rdquo; no mention is made; it never appears in
books, nor emerges in conversation.&nbsp; By the
&ldquo;Spectator&rdquo; it has been once quoted; by Rymer it has
once been praised; and by Dryden, in &ldquo;Mac Flecknoe,&rdquo;
it has once been imitated; nor do I recollect much other notice
from its publication till now in the whole succession of English
literature.</p>
<p>Of this silence and neglect, if the reason be inquired, it
will be found partly in the choice of the subject, and partly in
the performance of the work.</p>
<p>Sacred history has been always read with submissive reverence,
and an imagination overawed and controlled.&nbsp; We have been
accustomed to acquiesce in the nakedness and simplicity of the
authentic narrative, and to repose on its veracity with such
humble confidence as suppresses curiosity.&nbsp; We go with the
historian as he goes, and stop with him when he stops.&nbsp; All
amplification is frivolous and vain; all addition to that which
is already sufficient for the purposes of religion seems not only
useless, but in some degree profane.</p>
<p>Such events as were produced by the visible interposition of
Divine Power are above the power of human genius to
dignify.&nbsp; The miracle of creation, however it may teem with
images, is best described with little diffusion of language:
&ldquo;He spake the word, and they were made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are told that Saul &ldquo;was troubled with an evil
spirit;&rdquo; from this Cowley takes an opportunity of
describing hell, and telling the history of Lucifer, who was, he
says,</p>
<blockquote><p>Once general of a gilded host of sprites,<br />
Like Hesper leading forth the spangled nights;<br />
But down like lightning, which him struck, he came<br />
And roar&rsquo;d at his first plunge into the flame.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lucifer makes a speech to the inferior agents of mischief, in
which there is something of heathenism, and therefore of
impropriety; and, to give efficacy to his words, concludes by
lashing his breast with his long tail: Envy, after a pause, steps
out, and among other declarations of her zeal utters these
lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>Do thou but threat, loud storms shall make
reply,<br />
And thunder echo to the trembling sky;<br />
Whilst raging seas swell to so bold an height,<br />
As shall the fire&rsquo;s proud element affright,<br />
Th&rsquo; old drudging sun, from his long-beaten way,<br />
Shall at thy voice start, and misguide the day.<br />
The jocund orbs shall break their measured pace,<br />
And stubborn poles change their allotted place.<br />
Heaven&rsquo;s gilded troops shall flutter here and there,<br />
Leaving their boasting songs tuned to a sphere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every reader feels himself weary with this useless talk of an
allegorical being.</p>
<p>It is not only when the events are confessedly miraculous,
that fancy and fiction lose their effect; the whole system of
life, while the theocracy was yet visible, has an appearance so
different from all other scenes of human action, that the reader
of the sacred volume habitually considers it as the peculiar mode
of existence of a distinct species of mankind, that lived and
acted with manners uncommunicable; so that it is difficult even
for imagination to place us in the state of them whose story is
related, and by consequence their joys and griefs are not easily
adopted, nor can the attention be often interested in anything
that befalls them.</p>
<p>To the subject thus originally indisposed to the reception of
poetical embellishments, the writer brought little that could
reconcile impatience, or attract curiosity.&nbsp; Nothing can be
more disgusting than a narrative spangled with conceits; and
conceits are all that the &ldquo;Davideis&rdquo; supplies.</p>
<p>One of the great sources of poetical delight is description,
or the power of presenting pictures to the mind.&nbsp; Cowley
gives inferences instead of images, and shows not what may be
supposed to have been seen, but what thoughts the sight might
have suggested.&nbsp; When Virgil describes the stone which
Turnus lifted against &AElig;neas, he fixes the attention on its
bulk and weight:</p>
<blockquote><p>Saxum circumspicit ingens,<br />
Saxum antiquum, ingens, campo quod forte jacebat<br />
Limes agro positus, litem ut discerneret arvis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cowley says of the stone with which Cain slew his brother,</p>
<blockquote><p>I saw him fling the stone, as if he meant<br />
At once his murther and his monument.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the sword taken from Goliath, he says,</p>
<blockquote><p>A sword so great, that it was only fit<br />
To cut off his great head that came with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other poets describe Death by some of its common
appearances.&nbsp; Cowley says, with a learned allusion to
sepulchral lamps real or fabulous,</p>
<blockquote><p>&rsquo;Twixt his right ribs deep pierced the
furious blade,<br />
And open&rsquo;d wide those secret vessels where<br />
Life&rsquo;s light goes out, when first they let in air.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But he has allusions vulgar as well as learned in a visionary
succession of kings:</p>
<blockquote><p>Joas at first does bright and glorious show,<br />
In life&rsquo;s fresh morn his fame does early crow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Describing an undisciplined army, after having said with
elegance,</p>
<blockquote><p>His forces seem&rsquo;d no army, but a crowd<br />
Heartless, unarm&rsquo;d, disorderly, and loud,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he gives them a fit of the ague.</p>
<p>The allusions, however, are not always to vulgar things; he
offends by exaggeration as much as by diminution:</p>
<blockquote><p>The king was placed alone, and o&rsquo;er his
head<br />
A well-wrought heaven of silk and gold was spread.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever he writes is always polluted with some conceit:</p>
<blockquote><p>Where the sun&rsquo;s fruitful beams give metals
birth,<br />
Where he the growth of fatal gold does see,<br />
Gold, which alone more influence has than he.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In one passage he starts a sudden question to the confusion of
philosophy:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ye learned heads, whom ivy garlands grace,<br />
Why does that twining plant the oak embrace;<br />
The oak for courtship most of all unfit,<br />
And rough as are the winds that fight with it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His expressions have sometimes a degree of meanness that
surpasses expectation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nay, gentle guests, he cries, since now
you&rsquo;re in,<br />
The story of your gallant friend begin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a simile descriptive of the morning:</p>
<blockquote><p>As glimmering stars just at th&rsquo; approach of
day,<br />
Cashier&rsquo;d by troops, at last all drop away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dress of Gabriel deserves attention:</p>
<blockquote><p>He took for skin a cloud most soft and bright,<br
/>
That e&rsquo;er the mid-day sun pierced through with light;<br />
Upon his cheeks a lively blush he spread,<br />
Wash&rsquo;d from the morning beauties&rsquo; deepest red:<br />
An harmless flatt&rsquo;ring meteor shone for hair,<br />
And fell adown his shoulders with loose care;<br />
He cuts out a silk mantle from the skies,<br />
Where the most sprightly azure pleased the eyes;<br />
This he with starry vapours sprinkles all,<br />
Took in their prime ere they grow ripe and fall;<br />
Of a new rainbow ere it fret or fade,<br />
The choicest piece cut out, a scarf is made.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a just specimen of Cowley&rsquo;s imagery; what might
in general expressions be great and forcible, he weakens and
makes ridiculous by branching it into small parts.&nbsp; That
Gabriel was invested with the softest or brightest colours of the
sky, we might have been told, and been dismissed to improve the
idea in our different proportions of conception; but Cowley could
not let us go till he had related where Gabriel got first his
skin, and then his mantle, then his lace, and then his scarf, and
related it in the terms of the mercer and tailor.</p>
<p>Sometimes he indulges himself in a digression, always
conceived with his natural exuberance, and commonly, even where
it is not long, continued till it is tedious:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&rsquo; th&rsquo; library a few choice authors
stood,<br />
Yet &rsquo;twas well stored, for that small store was good;<br />
Writing, man&rsquo;s spiritual physic, was not then<br />
Itself, as now, grown a disease of men.<br />
Learning (young virgin) but few suitors knew;<br />
The common prostitute she lately grew,<br />
And with the spurious brood loads now the press;<br />
Laborious effects of idleness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the &ldquo;Davideis&rdquo; affords only four books, though
intended to consist of twelve, there is no opportunity for such
criticism as Epic poems commonly supply.&nbsp; The plan of the
whole work is very imperfectly shown by the third part.&nbsp; The
duration of an unfinished action cannot be known.&nbsp; Of
characters either not yet introduced, or shown but upon few
occasions, the full extent and the nice discriminations cannot be
ascertained.&nbsp; The fable is plainly implex, formed rather
from the &ldquo;Odyssey&rdquo; than the &ldquo;Iliad;&rdquo; and
many artifices of diversification are employed, with the skill of
a man acquainted with the beet models.&nbsp; The past is recalled
by narration, and the future anticipated by vision: but he has
been so lavish of his poetical art, that it is difficult to
imagine how he could fill eight books more without practising
again the same modes of disposing his matter; and perhaps the
perception of this growing incumbrance inclined him to
stop.&nbsp; By this abruption, posterity lost more instruction
than delight.&nbsp; If the continuation of the
&ldquo;Davideis&rdquo; can be missed, it is for the learning that
had been diffused over it, and the notes in which it had been
explained.</p>
<p>Had not his characters been depraved like every other part by
improper decorations, they would have deserved uncommon
praise.&nbsp; He gives Saul both the body and mind of a hero:</p>
<blockquote><p>His way once chose, he forward threat outright.<br
/>
Nor turned aside for danger or delight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the different beauties of the lofty Merah and the gentle
Michal are very justly conceived and strongly painted.</p>
<p>Rymer has declared the &ldquo;Davideis&rdquo; superior to the
&ldquo;Jerusalem&rdquo; of Tasso, &ldquo;which,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;the poet, with all his care, has not totally purged from
pedantry.&rdquo;&nbsp; If by pedantry is meant that minute
knowledge which is derived from particular sciences and studies,
in opposition to the general notions supplied by a wide survey of
life and nature, Cowley certainly errs, by introducing pedantry,
far more frequently than Tasso.&nbsp; I know not, indeed, why
they should be compared; for the resemblance of Cowley&rsquo;s
work to Tasso&rsquo;s is only that they both exhibit the agency
of celestial and infernal spirits, in which, however, they differ
widely; for Cowley supposes them commonly to operate upon the
mind by suggestion; Tasso represents them as promoting or
obstructing events by external agency.</p>
<p>Of particular passages that can be properly compared, I
remember only the description of Heaven, in which the different
manner of the two writers is sufficiently discernible.&nbsp;
Cowley&rsquo;s is scarcely description, unless it be possible to
describe by negatives; for he tells us only what there is not in
heaven.&nbsp; Tasso endeavours to represent the splendours and
pleasures of the regions of happiness.&nbsp; Tasso affords
images, and Cowley sentiments.&nbsp; It happens, however, that
Tasso&rsquo;s description affords some reason for Rymer&rsquo;s
censure.&nbsp; He says of the Supreme Being:</p>
<blockquote><p>H&agrave; sotto i piedi e fato e la natura<br />
Ministri humili, e&rsquo;l moto, e ch&rsquo;il misura.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second line has in it more of pedantry than perhaps can be
found in any other stanza of the poem.</p>
<p>In the perusal of the &ldquo;Davideis,&rdquo; as of all
Cowley&rsquo;s works, we find wit and learning unprofitably
squandered.&nbsp; Attention has no relief; the affections are
never moved; we are sometimes surprised, but never delighted; and
find much to admire, but little to approve.&nbsp; Still, however,
it is the work of Cowley, of a mind capacious by nature, and
replenished by study.</p>
<p>In the general review of Cowley&rsquo;s poetry it will be
found that he wrote with abundant fertility, but negligent or
unskilful selection; with much thought, but with little imagery;
that he is never pathetic, and rarely sublime; but always either
ingenious or learned, either acute or profound.</p>
<p>It is said by Denham in his elegy,</p>
<blockquote><p>To him no author was unknown,<br />
Yet what he writ was all his own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This wide position requires less limitation, when it is
affirmed of Cowley, than perhaps of any other poet.&mdash;He read
much, and yet borrowed little.</p>
<p>His character of writing was indeed not his own; he unhappily
adopted that which was predominant.&nbsp; He saw a certain way to
present praise; and, not sufficiently inquiring by what means the
ancients have continued to delight through all the changes of
human manners, he contented himself with a deciduous laurel, of
which the verdure in its spring was bright and gay, but which
time has been continually stealing from his brows.</p>
<p>He was in his own time considered as of unrivalled
excellence.&nbsp; Clarendon represents him as having taken a
flight beyond all that went before him; and Milton is said to
have declared that the three greatest English poets were Spenser,
Shakespeare, and Cowley.</p>
<p>His manner he had in common with others; but his sentiments
were his own.&nbsp; Upon every subject he thought for himself;
and such was his copiousness of knowledge, that something at once
remote and applicable rushed into his mind; yet it is not likely
that he always rejected a commodious idea merely because another
had used it: his known wealth was so great that be might have
borrowed without loss of credit, in his elegy on Sir Henry
Wotton, the last lines have such resemblance to the noble epigram
of Grotius on the death of Scaliger, that I cannot but think them
copied from it, though they are copied by no servile hand.</p>
<p>One passage in his &ldquo;Mistress&rdquo; is so apparently
borrowed from Donne, that he probably would not have written it
had it not mingled with his own thoughts, so as that he did not
perceive himself taking it from another:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although I think thou never found wilt be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet I&rsquo;m resolved to search for thee;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The search itself rewards the pains.<br />
So, though the chymic his great secret miss<br />
(For neither it in Art or Nature is),<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet things well worth his toil he gains:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And does his charge and labour pay<br />
With good unsought experiments by the way.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Cowley</span>.</p>
<p>Some that have deeper digg&rsquo;d Love&rsquo;s mine than
I,<br />
Say, where his centric happiness doth lie:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I have loved, and got, and told;<br />
But should I love, get, tell, till I were old,<br />
I should not find that hidden mystery;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, &rsquo;tis imposture all!<br />
And as no chymic yet th&rsquo; elixir got,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But glorifies his pregnant pot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If by the way to him befal<br />
Some odoriferous thing, or medicinal,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So lovers dream a rich and long delight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But get a winter-seeming summer&rsquo;s night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jonson and Donne, as Dr. Hurd remarks, were then in the
highest esteem.</p>
<p>It is related by Clarendon, that Cowley always acknowledged
his obligation to the learning and industry of Jonson: but I have
found no traces of Jonson in his works: to emulate Donne appears
to have been his purpose.; and from Donne ~he may have learnt
that familiarity with religious images, and that light allusion
to sacred things, by which readers far short of sanctity are
frequently offended; and which would not be borne in the present
age, when devotion, perhaps not more fervent, is more
delicate.</p>
<p>Having produced one passage taken by Cowley from Donne, I will
recompense him by another which Milton seems to have borrowed
from him.&nbsp; He says of Goliath:</p>
<blockquote><p>His spear, the trunk was of a lofty tree,<br />
Which Nature meant some tall ship&rsquo;s mast should be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Milton of Satan:</p>
<blockquote><p>His spear, to equal which the tallest pine<br />
Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the mast<br />
Of some great ammiral, were but a wand,<br />
He walked with.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His diction was in his own time censured as negligent.&nbsp;
He seems not to have known, or not to have considered, that words
being arbitrary must owe their power to association, and have the
influence, and that only, which custom has given them.&nbsp;
Language is the dress of thought; and as the noblest mien, or
most graceful action, would be degraded and obscured by a garb
appropriated to the gross employments of rustics or mechanics; so
the most heroic sentiments will lose their efficacy, and the most
splendid ideas drop their magnificence, if they are conveyed by
words used commonly upon low and trivial occasions, debased by
vulgar mouths, and contaminated by inelegant applications.</p>
<p>Truth indeed is always truth, and reason is always reason;
they have an intrinsic and unalterable value, and constitute that
intellectual gold which defies destruction; but gold may be so
concealed in baser matter, that only a chemist can recover it;
sense may be so hidden in unrefined and plebeian words, that none
but philosophers can distinguish it; and both may be so buried in
impurities, as not to pay the cost of their extraction.</p>
<p>The diction, being the vehicle of the thoughts, first presents
itself to the intellectual eye; and if the first appearance
offends, a further knowledge is not often sought.&nbsp; Whatever
professes to benefit by pleasing, must please at once.&nbsp; The
pleasures of the mind imply something sudden and unexpected; that
which elevates must always surprise.&nbsp; What is perceived by
slow degrees may gratify us with the consciousness of
improvement, but will never strike with the sense of
pleasure.</p>
<p>Of all this, Cowley appears to have been without knowledge, or
without care.&nbsp; He makes no selection of words, nor seeks any
neatness of phrase: he has no elegance either lucky or elaborate;
as his endeavours were rather to impress sentences upon the
understanding, than images on the fancy: he has few epithets, and
those scattered without peculiar propriety of nice
adaptation.</p>
<p>It seems to follow from the necessity of the subject, rather
than the care of the writer, that the diction of his heroic poem
is less familiar than that of his slightest writings.&nbsp; He
has given not the same numbers, but the same diction, to the
gentle Anacreon and the tempestuous Pindar.</p>
<p>His versification seems to have had very little of his care;
and if what he thinks be true, that his numbers are unmusical
only when they are ill-read, the art of reading them is at
present lost; for they are commonly harsh to modern ears.&nbsp;
He has indeed many noble lines, such as the feeble care of Waller
never could produce.&nbsp; The bulk of his thoughts sometimes
swelled his verse to unexpected and inevitable grandeur; but his
excellence of this kind is merely fortuitous: he sinks willingly
down to his general carelessness, and avoids with very little
care either meanness or asperity.</p>
<p>His contractions are often rugged and harsh:</p>
<blockquote><p>One flings a mountain, and its rivers too<br />
Torn up with &rsquo;t.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His rhymes are very often made by pronouns, or particles, or
the like unimportant words, which disappoint the ear, and destroy
the energy of the line.</p>
<p>His combination of different measures is sometimes dissonant
and unpleasing; he joins verses together, of which the former
does not slide easily into the latter.</p>
<p>The words &ldquo;do&rdquo; and &ldquo;did,&rdquo; which so
much degrade in present estimation the line that admits them,
were in the time of Cowley little censured or avoided; how often
he used them, and with how bad an effect, at least to our ears,
will appear by a passage, in which every reader will lament to
see just and noble thoughts defrauded of their praise by
inelegance of language:</p>
<blockquote><p>Where honour or where conscience <i>does</i> not
bind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No other law shall shackle me;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Slave to myself I ne&rsquo;er will be;<br />
Nor shall my future actions be confined<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By my own present mind.<br />
Who by resolves and vows engaged <i>does</i> stand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For days, that yet belong to fate,<br />
<i>Does</i> like an unthrift mortgage his estate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before it falls into his hand;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The bondman of the cloister so,<br />
All that he <i>does</i> receive <i>does</i> always owe.<br />
And still as Time comes in, it goes away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not to enjoy, but debts to pay!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unhappy slave, and pupil to a bell!<br />
Which his hour&rsquo;s work as well as hours <i>does</i> tell:<br
/>
Unhappy till the last, the kind releasing knell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His heroic lines are often formed of monosyllables; but yet
they are sometimes sweet and sonorous.</p>
<p>He says of the Messiah,</p>
<blockquote><p>Round the whole earth his dreaded name shall
sound,<br />
<i>And reach to worlds that must not yet be found</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another place, of David,</p>
<blockquote><p>Yet bid him go securely, when he sends;<br />
&rsquo;<i>Tis Saul that is his foe</i>, <i>and we his
friends</i>.<br />
<i>The man who has his God</i>, <i>no aid can lack</i>;<br />
<i>And we who bid him go</i>, <i>will bring him back</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet amidst his negligence he sometimes attempted an improved
and scientific versification; of which it will be best to give
his own account subjoined to this line:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Nor can the glory
contain itself in th&rsquo; endless space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry that it is necessary to admonish the most
part of readers, that it is not by negligence that this verse is
so loose, long, and, as it were, vast; it is to paint in the
number the nature of the thing which it describes, which I would
have observed in divers other places of this poem, that else will
pass as very careless verses: as before,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>And over-runs the
neighb&rsquo;ring fields with violent course</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the second book:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Down a precipice deep</i>,
<i>dowse he casts them all</i>&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>And fell a-down his shoulders
with loose care</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the third,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Brass was his helmet</i>, <i>his
boots brass</i>, <i>and o&rsquo;er</i><br />
<i>His breast a thick plate strong brass he wore</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the fourth,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Like some fair pine
o&rsquo;er-looking all the ignobler wood</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Some from the rocks cast
themselves down headlong</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And many more: but it is enough to instance in a
few.&nbsp; The thing is, that the disposition of words and
numbers should be such, as that, out of the order and sound of
them, the things themselves may be represented.&nbsp; This the
Greeks were not so accurate as to bind themselves to; neither
have our English poets observed it, for aught I can find.&nbsp;
The Latins (<i>qui musas colunt severiores</i>) sometimes did it;
and their prince, Virgil, always: in whom the examples are
innumerable, and taken notice of by all judicious men, so that it
is superfluous to collect them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know not whether he has, in many of these instances,
attained the representation or resemblance that he
purposes.&nbsp; Verse can imitate only sound and motion.&nbsp; A
&ldquo;boundless&rdquo; verse, a &ldquo;headlong&rdquo; verse,
and a verse of &ldquo;brass&rdquo; or of &ldquo;strong
brass,&rdquo; seem to comprise very incongruous and unsociable
ideas.&nbsp; What there is peculiar in the sound of the line
expressing &ldquo;loose care,&rdquo; I cannot discover; nor why
the &ldquo;pine&rdquo; is &ldquo;taller&rdquo; in an Alexandrine
than in ten syllables.</p>
<p>But, not to defraud him of his due praise, he has given one
example of representative versification, which perhaps no other
English line can equal:</p>
<blockquote><p>Begin, be bold, and venture to be wise:<br />
He, who defers this work from day to day,<br />
Does on a river&rsquo;s bank expecting stay<br />
Till the whole stream that stopp&rsquo;d him shall be gone,<br />
<i>Which runs</i>, <i>and</i>, <i>as it runs</i>, <i>for ever
shall run on</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cowley was, I believe, the first poet that mingled
Alexandrines at pleasure with the common heroic of ten syllables,
and from him Dryden borrowed the practice, whether ornamental or
licentious.&nbsp; He considered the verse of twelve syllables as
elevated and majestic, and has therefore deviated into that
measure when he supposes the voice heard of the Supreme
Being.</p>
<p>The author of the &ldquo;Davideis&rdquo; is commended by
Dryden for having written it in couplets, because he discovered
that any staff was too lyrical for an heroic poem; but this seems
to have been known before by May and Sandys, the translators of
the &ldquo;Pharsalia&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Metamorphoses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;Davideis&rdquo; are some hemistichs, or verses
left imperfect by the author, in imitation of Virgil, whom he
supposes not to have intended to complete them; that this opinion
is erroneous, may be probably concluded, because this truncation
is imitated by no subsequent Roman poet; because Virgil himself
filled up one broken line in the heat of recitation; because in
one the sense is now unfinished; and because all that can be done
by a broken verse, a line intersected by a <i>c&oelig;sura</i>,
and a full stop, will equally effect.</p>
<p>Of triplets in his &ldquo;Davideis&rdquo; he makes no use, and
perhaps did not at first think them allowable; but he appears
afterwards to have changed his mind, for in the verses on the
government of Cromwell he inserts them liberally with great
happiness.</p>
<p>After so much criticism on his poems, the essays which
accompany them must not be forgotten.&nbsp; What is said by Sprat
of his conversation, that no man could draw from it any suspicion
of his excellence in poetry, may be applied to these
compositions.&nbsp; No author ever kept his verse and his prose
at a greater distance from each other.&nbsp; His thoughts are
natural, and his style has a smooth and placid equability, which
has never yet obtained its due commendation.&nbsp; Nothing is
far-sought, or hard-laboured; but all is easy without feebleness,
and familiar without grossness.</p>
<p>It has been observed by Felton, in his Essay on the Classics,
that Cowley was beloved by every Muse that he courted; and that
he has rivalled the ancients in every kind of poetry but
tragedy.</p>
<p>It may be affirmed, without any encomiastic fervour, that he
brought to his poetic labours a mind replete with learning, and
that his pages are embellished with all the ornaments which books
could supply; that he was the first who imparted to English
numbers the enthusiasm of the greater ode, and the gaiety of the
less; that he was equally qualified for sprightly sallies, and
for lofty flights; that he was among those who freed translation
from servility, and, instead of following his author at a
distance, walked by his side; and that, if he left versification
yet improvable, he left likewise from time to time such specimens
of excellence as enabled succeeding poets to improve it.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
